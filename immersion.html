  <h2>Endless Summer</h2>


<p class="lead">Due to popular demand, this summer we are offering not 1 but <strong>2 Live Immersion Retreats!!!</p></strong> <h4>The last few years we had to turn so many people away because we didn't have any more space in our July class.  This year we want everyone who wants to come to be able to, so we worked with our partners at The Simsbury Inn, who graciously helped us squeeze in a second summer retreat! Now we have retreats <strong>June 29-July 5</strong> AND <strong>August 3-9th</strong>.  Cleanse your body and spirit with our award winning detox program, and enjoy our beautiful location: eating outside, walking or biking the area's trails, and more.  There really has never been a more perfect time to come! </h4>

<p class="lead">Don't wait, these summer retreats will be the LAST ONES THIS YEAR!</p>

After studying at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition I really thought I knew how to be healthy and how to teach others to do the same. But what I learned at RFI blew all my many years of nutritive education out of the water. It changed the way my family eats, the way I raise my kids and the way I help others to find their optimal health as well. I believe it to be such a pivotal and influential point in my life that I've encouraged everyone I truly care about to commit to the week away and learn to properly prevent disease and heal themselves for the rest of their life. It’s an unbelievably eye-opening experience!”<small><cite title="Source Title">Christi Flynn</cite></small></p></blockquote>

Determined to go a natural educated path an alkaline lifestyle became paramount. Along with alkaline water, alkaline foods were a must. Thank goodness my journey led me to Lisa Wilson and the Raw Food Institute. I enrolled in the 7 Day Immersion and Educator programs in October 2011 and have never looked back. I juice every day and follow a mostly raw diet. Today I am 23 pounds lighter and wearing a size 2/4!! Best thing was that the weight loss was actually a surprise and not my main goal. Getting healthy and living a long life was at the top of my heart. Working with Lisa and the Raw Food Institute has educated and supported me, so today I know what to do and do it with the confidence that I am in control.<small><cite title="Source Title">Elaine Gibson</cite></small></p></blockquote>

My 7 day raw food detox can only be described as a remarkable experience. Yes the weight loss is a great bonus, but the real treasure for me was the mental clarity, feeling of lightness, and radiance that was physically noticeable after the 7 days. Dealing with a health crisis can be scary, and the most valuable lesson I learned here at the RFI, is that your body has amazing powers to heal itself when given the chance.
