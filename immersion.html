After studying at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition I really thought I knew how to be healthy and how to teach others to do the same.

It changed the way my family eats, the way I raise my kids and the way I help others to find their optimal health as well. I believe it to be such a pivotal and influential point in my life that I've encouraged everyone I truly care about to commit to the week away and learn to properly prevent disease and heal themselves for the rest of their life.

Determined to go a natural educated path an alkaline lifestyle became paramount. Along with alkaline water, alkaline foods were a must. Thank goodness my journey led me to Lisa Wilson and the Raw Food Institute. I enrolled in the 7 Day Immersion and Educator programs in October 2011 and have never looked back. I juice every day and follow a mostly raw diet. Today I am 23 pounds lighter and wearing a size 2/4!! Best thing was that the weight loss was actually a surprise and not my main goal. Getting healthy and living a long life was at the top of my heart.
