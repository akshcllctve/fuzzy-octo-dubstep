The time I spent with Lisa Wilson gave me the knowledge to be able to heal my body from breast cancer without the use of conventional treatments.

After studying at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition I really thought I knew how to be healthy and how to teach others to do the same. But what I learned at RFI blew all my many years of nutritive education out of the water. It changed the way my family eats, the way I raise my kids and the way I help others to find their optimal health as well. I believe it to be such a pivotal and influential point in my life that I've encouraged everyone I truly care about to commit to the week away and learn to properly prevent disease and heal themselves for the rest of their life. It’s an unbelievably eye-opening experience!”<small><cite title="Source Title">Christi Flynn</cite></small></p></blockquote>

Determined to go a natural educated path an alkaline lifestyle became paramount. Along with alkaline water, alkaline foods were a must. Thank goodness my journey led me to Lisa Wilson and the Raw Food Institute. I enrolled in the 7 Day Immersion and Educator programs in October 2011 and have never looked back. I juice every day and follow a mostly raw diet. Today I am 23 pounds lighter and wearing a size 2/4!! Best thing was that the weight loss was actually a surprise and not my main goal. Getting healthy and living a long life was at the top of my heart. Working with Lisa and the Raw Food Institute has educated and supported me, so today I know what to do and do it with the confidence that I am in control.<small><cite title="Source Title">Elaine Gibson</cite></small></p></blockquote>

My 7 day raw food detox can only be described as a remarkable experience. Yes the weight loss is a great bonus, but the real treasure for me was the mental clarity, feeling of lightness, and radiance that was physically noticeable after the 7 days. Dealing with a health crisis can be scary, and the most valuable lesson I learned here at the RFI, is that your body has amazing powers to heal itself when given the chance. Lisa Wilson is a beautiful, intelligent and highly motivated woman on a mission to help heal all who come her way.<small><cite title="Source Title">Ian Scott</cite></small></p></blockquote>
