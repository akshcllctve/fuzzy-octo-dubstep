There’s no need to ever be wasteful. You can reuse the fibrous pulp leftover from juicing or making almond milk by making delicious crackers, cookies or other fun dishes, like falafel. Our favorite pulps to use are carrot, beet, and of course, almond. </p>

<p>One of the questions I get all of the time is what to do with leftover pulp.  We make almond milk everyday around here so there is always excess almond pulp laying around.  Try this amazing recipe from one of our Raw Chefs Eden Love! Almond “Pulp” Cookies -– make using leftover almond milk pulp!   What an awesome way to use it.</p>

	<p>Enjoy!</p>

<strong>Almond "Pulp" Cookies</strong><br><br>

<strong>2-4 Apples</strong> cut into chunks<br>
<strong>2-3 tbs coconut oil</strong> <br>
<strong>1/2 c. ground flax or chia seeds</strong><br>

<strong>Method:</strong><br>
In your blender, add apples, oil, honey or coconut nectar, and spices (and optional almond butter).  Blend well, adding a little water if necessary.  Add to bowl with almond pulp and ground flax.  Mix well.  Form into little cookie shapes on nonstick dehydrator trays, garnishing each with a raisin or goji berry if desired.  Dehydrate a few hours, flip, peel off nonstick sheets and return to the dehydrator until the cookies are as soft or firm as you would like them to be.

Prepare all the ingredients and mix.  Serve over the avocado halves. That's it!  Enjoy!~<br><br>
