<p id="watch-headline-title"><strong>TEDxNewportCoast TEDxChange2012 - Annabel Ruffell - Journey for Earth Web Series</strong></p>
<p>A few times a week, I'm typically video interviewed by someone. Last week by Annabel Ruffell. Here's her Ted talk. I love working with elevated global visionaries. She's remarkable. She also asked me this:::
1) What Journey are You on?</p>
<p>~~I'm not entirely certain where my direction left off &amp; fate took over. This journey has now become much, much bigger than me. Going a different direction, does not even feel like an option at this point. I know my life is a vessel. I'm here to help others find their light,&amp; their purpose. Excellent food is the door that opens this, but it is so much more than that. With excellent food comes clarity of mind, a body that feels glorious &amp; a soul that is free to be what it desires to be. My job is to help facilitate that journey for others. It is a gift. It is how I live on purpose.... Lisa Wilson</p>
