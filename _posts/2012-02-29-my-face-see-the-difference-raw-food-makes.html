<h2 align="center"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lisa...  What happened to your FACE???</span></strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<p>Only your best friends and those that truly love you would have the audacity to ask such a question, yet this is how my January went….</p>

<p>So what happened to my face????  For real?</p>

<p><strong>COOKED FOOD HAPPENED TO MY FACE!!! </strong>  (Seriously….  )</p>

<p>Here is the story:</p>

<p>In October, I discovered a lump on my thyroid.  I was diagnosed with “incurable” graves disease.  (Which, by the way, is gone now(holistically, I might add), but I will save that story for another day.  I did not feel so hot, nor did my throat/thyroid.  Cooked foods seemed to sooth my throat.   Although, I’m not sure if this was true, or just my craving my old ways after nearly 3 years of raw foods.  I've always been completely honest.  I am all raw for some parts of the year, but not all raw, all the time.  In the winter, I tend to be 80-90% raw.  When my thyroid blew out, I flip flopped that.  I was about 20% raw, and 80% cooked.  After 3 months of eating this way, it showed up on my face!!!!  YIKES!!!   You see, I’m only in DC quarterly, so my friends and colleagues there would notice a change….  I heard things like this:</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">**WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FACE?</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">**YOU LOOK SWOLLEN, OR BLOATED!</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">**YOU LOOK LIKE YOU’RE ON STEROIDS.</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">**YOU LOOK LIKE YOU’VE HAD YOUR WISDOM TEETH REMOVED.</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">**YOU LOOK TIRED.</span></strong></p>

<p>None of these statements above are something anybody wants to hear….</p>

<p>I’m happy to report that after just 2 weeks of being back to 100% raw, my “face” was able to correct itself.  Remember, your outside is a reflection of what is going on inside…  My face was my indication that my body was really wanting more of natures finest foods—RAW FOODS!!!</p>

<p>These pictures speak for themselves!!!</p>

<p>I have to admit, it is difficult for me to see my bloated face….</p>

<p>So here is a recap of what “happened” to my face:</p>

<p>I'VE NEVER CLAIMED TO BE PERFECT…. BUT ALWAYS AUTHENTIC!!!!</p>

<p>I mentioned recently that everything that 1<sup>st</sup> appears to be bad, is actually good.  I still believe this.  I looked “puffy” for a reason.  It is to get me back to what I know to be the best way to care for myself…..</p>
