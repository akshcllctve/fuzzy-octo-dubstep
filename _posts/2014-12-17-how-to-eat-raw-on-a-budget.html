<p class="lead">Eating raw food doesn't need to break the bank.  In fact, there's a-lot of delicious, super-healthy raw options that can save you money.  Check out these amazing tips we've learned over the years to eat raw and healthy on a budget.</p>




<h3>1.)  Sprouts!  </h3>

<p class="lead">Growing sprouts in your own kitchen is one of the most affordable ways to eat raw.  About $3.50 per small baggie at Whole Foods, or $1.50 for a whole tray that will make 6-8 salads!  The best part, there are endless varieties of things you can sprout.  Lentils, fenugreek, mung beans, garbanzo beans, clover sprouts, broccoli sprouts are all top choices.  Not only are they cheap, but they are some of nature's fines foods on the planet.

<h3>2.)  Stock your pantry   </h3>

<p class="lead">Buy items such as nuts and seeds when they are on sale and begin to stock your pantry.  These items have very long shelf lives so they will last a long time.  The key is to use what you have!  Create or make recipes with the ingredients you have on hand.  This will also allow your creative juices to be flowing!  I would suggest buying in bulk--like 5 or 10 pounds, instead of on sale.  On sale can indicate the nuts & seeds are old.  They can easily go rancid, so it is important to get high quality, fresh nuts and seeds.

<h3>3.)  Compare pricing  </h3>

<p class="lead"> Shopping bulk is always cheaper right?  WRONG.  I am so surprised when I actually compare the per ounce price of bulk organic nuts and seeds to the version offered on the shelf.  At least half of the time the shelf version is cheaper.  This is particularly true at stores that move a lot of inventory, such as Whole Foods.  Be aware of stores that don't move a lot of bulk inventory, as it can go bad.  Always check the per ounce price and go with the lower price.  Don’t forget that you can order these online as well.  Make sure you include the shipping price when comparing prices.

<h3>4.)  Plan ahead</h3>

<h3>5.)  Sustainable Dehydrating </h3>

<p class="lead">There’s no need to ever be wasteful. You can reuse the fibrous pulp leftover from juicing or making almond milk by making delicious crackers, cookies or other fun dishes, like falafel. Our favorite pulps to use are carrot, beet, and of course, almond.

<h3>6.)  Stock up on fresh items that have a longer shelf life such as carrots, root veggies, onions, garlic, etc. </h3>

<p class="lead">This helps so that fresh items won’t go bad.

<h3>7.)  Cabbage! </h3>

<p class="lead">Cabbage is one of the cheapest foods.  I once heard an economist say that cabbage is the most nutritionally dense cheapest food available, most bang for your buck.  Cabbage is a key ingredient in fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, etc.  Get creative with what you can do with the cabbage.
