<p>I don’t know about you but I have been craving sprouts this summer!  I also had some extra grapefruit I was looking to use up.  I also like to get my Brazil nuts in each day for the selenium and they are also a great source of protein.  The avocados are a great way to get healthy fats and some oomph in the salad.  And my favorite is the kick from the cayenne in the dressing..  Put them all together and you have a power packed lunch.   This salad is an amazing pick me up and can really help you get through the day!  What I love most about it is how simple it is.  This salad can be made in 5 minutes!
