<p>Hi it's Lisa Wilson with The Raw Food Institute bringing you your 2-Minute Health Tip of the day!  </p><p>So it's SPRING!  The trees have not even bloomed yet, but this time of year can be really bothersome for people who have seasonal allergies, specifically my 13 year old son. He can tell you all about that.  He's always rubbing his eyes and MISERABLE for a month, sometimes 2 straight in the spring. </p>
<p> One thing that really helped in our family, was bringing in the local bee pollen.  Wherever you live in the country, find someone local who is making bee pollen, royal jelly, or local honey.  You need to find LOCAL to make it effective. Just put it in raw ceral or mix it with your greens.  Add it to your meals throughout the day.  It's really simple.  You just need a little bit, a little bit goes a long way.This can completely alleviate many of the seasonal allergies symptoms!</p><p>  That's the 2-Minute Health Tip for today, I hope you try it and it works for your family too!
