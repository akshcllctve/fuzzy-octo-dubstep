WANT LEAN MUSCLE MASS....?
MY LOVE AFFAIR WITH ALPHA LIPOIC ACID!
<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2016" style="margin: 4px;" title="lean muscle mass" src="http://therawfoodinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/563013_4126202147872_2096308072_n.jpg" alt="lean muscle mass" width="133" height="133" />My love affair with Alpha Lipoic Acid began in November of 2011. I won't go into the details today, but when I was diagnosed with "incurable" Graves disease last year, ALA was one of the (3) superstar supplements that reversed my situation in record time--just 6 weeks flat. My research of ALA, led me to the life work of Dr. Berkson, or New Mexico. His 1st experience was when he was able to save 2 terminal patients that had eaten poisonous mushrooms &amp; their livers were shutting down. They'd been given 48 hours to live. Dr. Berkson had some intravenous ALA flown in. The 2 patients were good as new in 2 weeks. (((BTW, I take oral ALA.))) He's spent 23 years of his career studying ALA. For the other crazy researchers, like me, here is his website: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fdrberkson.com%2F&amp;h=JAQFzwScw&amp;s=1" rel="nofollow nofollow" target="_blank">http://drberkson.com/</a>

<div>My experience: within 6 short weeks, my thyroid was good as new, the lumps are gone, and I've never an issue since. My voice is golden and my hair has not fallen out by the fistful in months. It will soon be a year since that ordeal. Recently: while working closely with a local holistic physician(MD), I've make several recommendations to our client, who has the desire to increase her bone density naturally. While the list is tall with recommendations, it turns out that ALA is good for increasing bone density as well!</div>

<div><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2018" style="margin: 4px;" title="308355_4126207788013_1571370562_n" src="http://therawfoodinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/308355_4126207788013_1571370562_n.jpg" alt="ALA" width="133" height="133" />Dosage? 2 ounces or a handful a day. Research indicates that ALA is good for: organ tissue repair auto-immune disease improved eye sight cognitive brain function improved workouts lean muscle mass and more! Ok, so now to the fun stuff. After about 4 months on ALA, I began to notice significant changes in my body. I've always admired women with GREAT ARMS. I think defined arms is sexy. However, this is something that I was never able to achieve--until now, at the age of 43! My arms are in the best shape of my life! I also began taking body pump classes around the same time, which I highly recommend and love. That said, I was a fitness trainer myself for years &amp; I was never able to achieve these results. Here is some info on ALA from the book, "The Four Hour Body", by Tim Ferriss. BTW, TIM FERRISS ROCKS &amp; I highly recommend reading any &amp; all of his books... Some of his cutting edge info will blow your mind, plus HE IS SUPER FUNNY! Please read all of the scientific data Tim presents.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here is a one sentence summary: "ALA HELPS YOU STORE THE CARBOHYDRATES YOU EAT IN YOUR MUSCLE OR IN YOUR LIVER AS OPPOSED TO IN FAT." He also notes that ALA is a potent antioxidant and a free radical scavenger that has proven to regenerate vitamin c and vitamin e, restore levels of intracellular glutathione, an important antioxidant and increases the secretion of toxic metals, such as mercury. WOW~! HOW MUCH DO YOU LOVE THIS?? ALA is part of Tim Ferriss's PAGG protocol. CHECK IT OUT FOR LEAN MUSCLE MASS AND OTHER HEALTH BENEFITS !!!!!!!!</div>
<div></div>
<div>So gobble up your walnuts &amp; consider speaking with you holistic physician to see if ALA is right for you! It just may change your life too!!! IT CHANGED MINE!</div>
