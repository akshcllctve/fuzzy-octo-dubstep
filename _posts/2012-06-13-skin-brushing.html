One of my clients has lost a good chunk of weight over time. Upon speaking with him, he shared with me that skin brushing daily, over the course of a year, has taken care of all that extra flabby skin. What great insight!!! I've coached many, many people who have lost weight, and are left with a new problem: way too much skin! This is such a great solution, without surgery! Thanks G!!! ;) Way to go!
