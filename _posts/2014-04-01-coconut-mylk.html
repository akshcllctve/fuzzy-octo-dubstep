I make nut mylks all of the time but also have a need for coconut mylk for raw curries, pad thai’s, etc.  This inspired me to make my own coconut mylk.  In doing some quick research I  learned that to make a coconut mylk you must use a mature coconut which is slightly harder to open in my opinion than the young thai coconut.  I must admit it took me at least 30 minutes to open and prepare properly but left me feeling very accomplished after.</p>

<p class="lead">Before we get started, make sure you have the right kind of coconut! A mature coconut has a hard shell and some hair on the outside. This is the kind you want to use.  </p>

<p class="lead">A young thai coconut - shown below - has no shell and a soft outside. This is not the kind you want to use to make coconut mylk! </p>

<p class="lead">1. First I used my hammer to crack the coconut then I pried it open.  You can also use a large knife to open the coconut.  The coconut water comes squirting out as soon as you crack the coconut so be prepared.  I can’t resist drinking it right away.</p>

<p class="lead">2. Once it was in large sections/pieces I hammered the shell more and the meat popped out out of the shell.  </p>

<p class="lead">3.Then I peeled it with a small peeling knife until just the meat was left.</p>

<p class="lead">4. I used the meat from one coconut and placed it in the vita-mix along with 3-4 cups of water.  Then I blended it on high speed for 2 minutes.  </p>

<p class="lead">5. From there I simply poured it through a nut mylk bag and separated the mylk from the pulp.  </p>

<p class="lead">The end result is magical.  The taste of handmade coconut mylk was so satisfying.  Enjoy!</p>
