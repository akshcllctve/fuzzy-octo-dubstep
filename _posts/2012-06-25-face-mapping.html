<p>It is amazing how much one can tell about someone, just by looking at their face! Remarkable. I can tell immediately if they have congestion in the colon, kidneys, heart issues etc... The body sends other indicators as well such as streaks on the nail beds, red spots that appear on the skin and so much more! So much fun to learn &amp; generally spot on!
</p>
<p>Face-mapping has many origins including Chinese medicine.
From:<br>
N'jyla Xhamayca Innerarity your nose is your Heart. <br>
your upper lip = small intestines<br>
your lower lips = large intestines<br>
under your eyes = a combo...of organs...</p>
