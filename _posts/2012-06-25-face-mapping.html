It is amazing how much one can tell about someone, just by looking at their face! Remarkable. I can tell immediately if they have congestion in the colon, kidneys, heart issues etc... The body sends other indicators as well such as streaks on the nail beds, red spots that appear on the skin and so much more! So much fun to learn &amp; generally spot on!

Face-mapping has many origins including Chinese medicine.
From:
N'jyla Xhamayca Innerarity your nose is your Heart.
your upper lip = small intestines
your lower lips = large intestines
under your eyes = a combo...of organs...

I've put a book below by Markus Rothkranz you may enjoy about face mapping, what it all means &amp; how to correct it! Very cool book. I think you will enjoy it! I love this book.

Different philosophies will examine different things in regards to which organs are served.Â  If you want more info on this, please read Heal Your Face. It's excellent!
