Did you know that by the time a tumor shows up in a particular part of the body, in 3/4 of the population, it has already spread somewhere else in the body? This is why we can not just remove body parts &amp; hope everything is ok. Cancer is not a local disease. It is systemic.... Blood is pumped throughout the body, every 3 minutes. The blood carries cancers cells to all parts of the body. It is time we treat the whole person, not the tumor.
Tumors are the bodies way of taking care of itself &amp; attempting to encapsulate rapidly multiplying cells. There is no wisdom in poking &amp; disrupting a tumor with a needle biopsy.~~~</span></div>
<div class="_wk mbm"><span class="userContent">
**A study at the John Wayne Cancer Institute issued a report in 2004 that suggested that needle biopsies can spread cancer from an isolated tumor to a nearby lymph node by 50 percent. The team of scientist studied 633 women who had breast cancer. Half of them were diagnosed with cancer through a needle biopsy, and the other half had undergone a lumpectomy. The researchers found that the women who had undergone a needle biopsy were 50 percent more likely to have cancer in their sentinel nodes than women who had undergone a lumpectomy. Researchers think that the cancer was spread because the needle disrupted the isolated tumor and caused cancerous cells from the tumor to travel to the nearby lymph nodes.</span></div>

Do you know the definition of a 'cure' in the conventional medical world? It means that if you live just one day past the 5 yr mark, you are 'cured.' It means that if you get multiple surgeries, radiation &amp; chemotherapy &amp; live 5 yrs &amp; one day, you are cured. It means that if you are bloated, have neuropathy &amp; are in miserable pain, you are cured. The numbers look rosy, because they are manipulated. Scare tactics. The truth is these treatments work about 1% of the time. The truth is that 70% of oncologists would not allow their own family members to have these treatments. Chemotherapy &amp; radiation actually cause cancer. The medical term for this is 2nd cancers cancers caused by a primary cancer cure. These 'therapies' permanently damage cells.
