<p>Did you know that by the time a tumor shows up in a particular part of the body, in 3/4 of the population, it has already spread somewhere else in the body? This is why we can not just remove body parts &amp; hope everything is ok. Cancer is not a local disease. It is systemic.... Blood is pumped throughout the body, every 3 minutes. The blood carries cancers cells to all parts of the body. It is time we treat the whole person, not the tumor.</p>
<p>Tumors are the bodies way of taking care of itself &amp; attempting to encapsulate rapidly multiplying cells. There is no wisdom in poking &amp; disrupting a tumor with a needle biopsy.~~~</p>

<p>**A study at the John Wayne Cancer Institute issued a report in 2004 that suggested that needle biopsies can spread cancer from an isolated tumor to a nearby lymph node by 50 percent. The team of scientist studied 633 women who had breast cancer. Half of them were diagnosed with cancer through a needle biopsy, and the other half had undergone a lumpectomy. The researchers found that the women who had undergone a needle biopsy were 50 percent more likely to have cancer in their sentinel nodes than women who had undergone a lumpectomy. Researchers think that the cancer was spread because the needle disrupted the isolated tumor and caused cancerous cells from the tumor to travel to the nearby lymph nodes.</p>

<p>Do you know the definition of a 'cure' in the conventional medical world? It means that if you live just one day past the 5 yr mark, you are 'cured.' It means that if you get multiple surgeries, radiation &amp; chemotherapy &amp; live 5 yrs &amp; one day, you are cured. It means that if you are bloated, have neuropathy &amp; are in miserable pain, you are cured. The numbers look rosy, because they are manipulated. Scare tactics. The truth is these treatments work about 1% of the time. The truth is that 70% of oncologists would not allow their own family members to have these treatments. Chemotherapy &amp; radiation actually cause cancer. The medical term for this is 2nd cancers cancers caused by a primary cancer cure. These 'therapies' permanently damage cells.
