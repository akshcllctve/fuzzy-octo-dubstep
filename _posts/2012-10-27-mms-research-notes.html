<p>Lisa Wilson here; IT'S INTENSE. IT'S CONTROVERSIAL. SO, (NATURALLY) I'VE DONE IT... I consider this one of the most profound things I have ever done for my health. Results: Lots of necessary things were excreted from my body (sorry for those of you who consider this TMI).</p>

<p>My body felt cleaner, lighter &amp; the best news was that my (then rock hard) fiber cystic breasts were completely broken up &amp; soft. Night sweats, cough, runny nose, fever, mild diarrhea, acne breakouts, nausea etc. These were some of my detox symptoms when I did MMS.</p>

<p>Jim Humble is the main researcher on this topic. His results with malaria, HIV, parasites &amp; cancer are completely mind numbing. If you do this: 1. Have a holistic physician oversee your program. This is not mild stuff-it's intense. 2. Add 1/2 of a juiced lime of lemon to your drink, then it is doable. 3. Go slowly. I HOPE EVERYONE WATCHES THIS FULL DOCUMENTARY!!!</p>

<p>***I studied this yrs ago, but abandoned my research due to the FDA warnings. You can see JIm Humble's response to the FEA warnings here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmkfr8bIajc%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F" rel="nofollow nofollow" target="_blank">www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmkfr8bIajc/////</a></p>

<p>When some dear friends in the health industry brought this again to my attention, and actually put a bottle in my hand, I knew I had to resume my research. WHAT I FOUND WAS UNBELIEVABLE. I personally know several people who attribute major shifts in their healing to MMS. BTW, Jim Humble &amp; his team have now developed a new cancer protocol using MMS &amp; MMS 2, if that is your purpose. If you are a researcher like me, you will LOVE THIS INFORMATION. IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND! **** AS ALWAYS..... THIS IS NEVER, EVER, EVER TO BE CONFUSED WITH MEDICAL ADVICE. I AM MERELY SHARING MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH YOU. PLEASE FIND YOUR OWN BANG UP, SUPER COOL, WAY OPEN MINDED MEDICAL PHYSICIAN TO SUPPORT YOU WITH YOUR PERSONAL HEALTH GOALS.....
