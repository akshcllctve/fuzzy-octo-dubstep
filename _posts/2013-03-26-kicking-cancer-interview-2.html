<p><strong>Carol's story.</strong></p>

<p>This is the Second cancer survivor interview in the 6 part series by Lisa Wilson of the Raw Food Institute.
“<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2392" style="margin: 4px;" alt="Kicking Cancer to the Curb interviews with Lisa Wilson and Carol" src="http://therawfoodinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/561327_436046193074277_75180202_n-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" />January of 2009 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I always knew that if I were ever faced with this situation, conventional therapies were not for me. I was under extreme pressure from my conventional physicians to pursuer a route with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Called at home on Sat &amp; Sun. They actually yelled at me and told me that I would die if I didn’t. Also yelled at John and told him he could face "serious consequences" if he did not make me get treatment. This is what I know for sure: under their care, I probably would have died. I firmly believe this. Not from my cancer, but from their “cures.”</p>

<p>However, one of the most profound pieces to this puzzle was my RAW diet. Diet was huge! In February I began working with Lisa Wilson. I completely overhauled my life (and my husband’s) and embarked on a RAW-VEGAN-HEALING-DIET. I could not be happier with my decision. My left breast had 2 tumors. The first was very large—the size of a fist; the second was the size of a -Thumb 1 cm x 2 cm were the measurements from the sonogram. Today all of that (fist size) tissue has broken up. It all feels like soft &amp; normal breast tissue.</p>

<p>I instead chose a path to wellness that made sense to me.</p>

<p>I took herbal supplements, Vitamin C IV, and other alternative medicines. I really think the artimesinin moved this lump out so quickly. I really wish I would have had you feel it in the beginning because it's changed so much now. You'd be amazed!</p>

<p>I have lost 40 pounds and I feel great. I have my youthful body back! And I actually enjoy shopping again!</p>

<p>I know this is my lifestyle for a lifetime. It has to be a lifetime change or else I'll be back in the same situation in a very short time. I am enjoying making new raw entrees and recipes and continuing to learn in the process. Raw food tastes great!</p>

<p>My life is a blessing. My wish is for everyone to discover the truth about healing and then to heal themselves too. (this couldn't be more true, I want to shout it from the roof tops!!!)We would all be amazed if we just listened to the power of food!</p>
