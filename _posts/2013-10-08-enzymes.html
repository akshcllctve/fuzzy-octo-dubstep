*** Did you know that according to TIME magazine, 97% of Americans can not remember the last time they ate a salad?
*** As we age, typically, our bodies produce 13% fewer enzymes than the decade before. Yikes!!
Sort of explains why we are enzyme deficient, right?
Your body has many types of digestive enzymes. RAW food is abundant in digestive enzymes. Enzymes help break the good down so we can actually use the nutrients in the food.
<h3>This photo is a digestive enzyme experiment.</h3>
Bowl on left: straight up cooked oatmeal
Top bowl: oatmeal with 4 (RFI brand) digestive enzymes added to it
Red bowl: juice plus reds, from whole foods &amp; natural digestive enzymes
Green bowl: juice plus greens, from whole foods &amp; natural digestive enzymes
You can see how the oatmeal bowls with digestive enzymes have turned to liquid. In other words, these plant based digestive enzymes have broken down the food, to get access to the nutrients.

***For people starting to eat more raw foods with trouble digesting it.... it likely is necessary to take digestive enzymes during the transitional stages to avoid bloating &amp; discomfort.


Helps break down the food &amp; absorb all those beautiful nutrients! Works like a charm!</p>
