Do you know the history of Essiac Tea? The native Ojibway tea? A native Ojibway woman gave the recipe to Rene Caisse before she died. The tea, she said had healed her breast cancer decades before she died. Rene, a Canadian, went on to prepare the tea for tens of thousands of people who traveled miles to get it. She has documented tens of thousands of cases of people who have healed. Variations of this tea are still available today. You may know, I was inspired to go into the field of nutrition when a family friend healed her cancer with raw foods and natural solutions over 19 yrs ago. Essiac Tea is one of Linda's 6 step protocol. I've put the 1st video of this series here. IT'S COMPLETELY FASCINATING.... Yes, I drink Essiac for prevention.
