Hi, Lisa wilson here with The Raw Food Institute.

I am soooo thrilled that we are here, celebrating out one year anniversary! It has been an amazing journey. When I look back at all those who have been through our raw food immersion program in Washington DC, at NIHA, I am literally in awe.

I'm in awe of how spectacular the results have been!!!!

What is the magic of raw food???

When you put RAW AND LIVING foods into your body, everything begins to change. Your cells become nourished on a cellular level. Even the best physicians can not articulate the synergies of these medicinal foods working together.

I like to call a raw detox, a REBOOT!

Many people experience abundant energy, and even the reversal of disease. These people move from simply surviving to THRIVING!!!!

It is am amazing thing to witness.

Pleases watch this video below to see just some of the reactions from Raw Food Institute participants.
