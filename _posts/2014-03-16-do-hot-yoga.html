 Good morning! It's Lisa Wilson here with The Raw Food Institute, at the Raw Living Expo with the co-founder of the Raw Living Expo -  the amazing, the incredible, they always say you can do 16 tasks at one time - Laura Fox. So I caught up with her this morning to give us her 2-Minute Health Tip of the day, so go Laura!</P>

 <p>So my 2-Minute Health Tip is DO HOT YOGA.  Now hot yoga is something that really works for my body.  I know that it takes a little doing to get used to it, get your system used to having that kind of heat.  But you sweat so much, you're just like dripping, you're drenched with sweat when your doing this process, so it's like pushing things out, it's keeping everything lubricated, keeping everything moving.  You can get so strong with yoga, it's absolutely amazing. -Laura Fox</p>
