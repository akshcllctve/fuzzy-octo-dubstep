While the pH of your saliva can vary greatly (depending on your last meal), the pH of your urine is often a reflection of the pH of your tissues. Test your 1st morning urine &amp; again about 2pm. Your am urine will may be slightly more acidic, as you are throwing toxins off at night. If you are 4, 5 or 6.... your body is screaming something to you. Bacteria, viruses, mold, fungus, parasites &amp; cancer thrive in an acidic body, but can not survive in an alkaline environment. You can bring your pH levels up by changing your diet. Add in plenty of greens &amp; fresh green juices. If you are super low, you want to seek the guidance of a holistic health professional. You may want to consider sodium bicarbonate, chlorine dioxide (MMS), mineral rich salts and hydrogen peroxide drips, or baths.
