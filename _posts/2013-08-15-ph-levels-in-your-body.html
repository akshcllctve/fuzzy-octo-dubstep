**Do you know the pH levels in your body? While this is one of the best (and easiest) indicators of great health, it is also the most under utilized. Optimal pH levels is 7.35, or close to this. While the pH of your saliva can vary greatly (depending on your last meal), the pH of your urine is often a reflection of the pH of your tissues. Test your 1st morning urine &amp; again about 2pm. Your am urine will may be slightly more acidic, as you are throwing toxins off at night. If you are 4, 5 or 6.... your body is screaming something to you. Bacteria, viruses, mold, fungus, parasites &amp; cancer thrive in an acidic body, but can not survive in an alkaline environment. You can bring your pH levels up by changing your diet. Add in plenty of greens &amp; fresh green juices. If you are super low, you want to seek the guidance of a holistic health professional. You may want to consider sodium bicarbonate, chlorine dioxide (MMS), mineral rich salts and hydrogen peroxide drips, or baths.
