<p>In this fun new 2-Minute Health Tip, Lisa Wilson talks about the benefits of vitamin D.</p>
Hello sunshine!  Hi it's Lisa Wilson with The Raw Food Institute bringing you your 2-Minute Health Tip of the day. 
</p><p>
So, sunshine is bad for you right? You should hide from it.  You should go inside, or slab yourself with sunscreen.  Wrong!  All that stuff, you know when my kids were little, when they were babies I would tell my mother in law when she would come and care of them, "they can only come out before 10 a.m. and after 4, and keep hats on them and slather them with sunscreen." 
</p><p>
We do the best we can with what we know at the time, but that was just wrong!  My question to you today is, do you know your vitamin D levels?  Because they are one of the most protective things we can do for our health and for our bodies. They can protect agains multiple types of cancers.  They can improve our immunity. It just makes you feel good, and it makes you feel good for a reason because it is good.  
</p><p>


So I go to the lake and I see these moms slathering up their kids with all this chemical sunscreen, and the fact is we don't want to burn, so when we choose sunscreen choose wisely, choose a chemical free sunscreen.  But, get some sun! Get some sun every single day!

</p><p>

This is for your immunity, it protects you from multiple types of cancers.  Some types of doctors are suggesting that up to 70% of cancers can be avoided with adequate vitamin D levels alone.  So know your numbers.  Numbers normal are between 30 and 100.  Do you want to be normal?  No! You want to be in the high end.  Most doctors suggest you want to be above 50. Some holistic physicians say you want to be in the 70-100 range.

</p><p>

Can you get vitamin D toxicity? Yes, so you want to know your levels.  But you can't get too much vitamin D from the sun.  It's a naturals synthesis that happens in the skin.
</p><p>
So vitamin D is important for conversion, this blending or utilizing of minerals in your diet like magnesium and vitamin K. All these things synergistically work together.  If you can't get in the sun, because we live in the north here then you want to be supplementing with vitamin D.  Specifically in the winter time you want to be something, most doctors are saying between 6000-8000 IUs per day, it used to be 1000-2000.  Work with your holistic doctor on this, get your levels checked. Know your levels and get some sun and have fun doing it!
