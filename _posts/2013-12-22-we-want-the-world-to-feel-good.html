<p class="lead">Over the past three years, here at The Raw Food Institute, we are honored to have touched thousands of lives. </p>

<p>Hundreds of people come to our speaking events and retreats every quarter, and are achieving healthier, happier living through a plant based, raw food diet. This year our goal is to raise awareness even further, into the mainstream.</p>

<p>The message is getting out, and people are starting to know somebody, or know somebody who knows somebody who healed their body, or just felt completely different in a profound way by incorporating green juice and raw food into their life.  </p>

<p>
I mean really, thats what its all about.  We want everyone to feel this good inside and step into their best life.</p>
