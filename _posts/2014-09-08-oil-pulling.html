Hi it's Lisa Wilson with The Raw Food Institute bringing you your 2-Minute Health Tip of the day.
</p><p>
So, we are talking about oil pulling.  Some of you might be really experienced with oil pulling and others of you are going - what in the world is she talking about?  I know the first time I heard about oil pulling that's what I was thinking. 
</p><p>
What is oil pulling?  First of all it's an ancient <a href="http://www.chopra.com/our-services/ayurveda" target ="_blank">ayurvedic  </a> technique.  Now the cool part is it's highly effective.  For what?  Well for so, so many reasons!
</p><p>
I use oil pulling to clean my teeth.  I use oil pulling to get into the spaces that I can't get at. The really beautiful thing about oil pulling is that once it gets in those cracks and crevices that you can't get at, it's actually drawing toxins up.  Some people even suggest you can detoxify all the way down through your meridians to your organs!  
</p><p>
We know oil pulling is ridiculously healthy for us.  It is a great way, again to keep that little micro-flora in your mouth. The last thing you want to do is take some mouthwash that will destroy all the bacteria, the healthy bacteria, the good the bad and everything in between.  That's where you really can create an imbalance.  
</p><p>
So you want to keep that balance by using things that are naturally anti-microbial and anti-bacterial like coconut oil.  Alot of ayurvedic techniques use sesame oil, there are a variety of different oils that you can use.  The goal is to keep it in your mouth for - they say 20 minutes - I'm saying 10-20 minutes.  Sometimes it's really difficult.  The reason it's difficult is you can't swallow.  This oil as it pulls, draws all these toxins and becomes so toxic, you don't want to swallow it, you need to spit it out.  
</p><p>
So, it's drawing these toxins out, you're walking around - I do it in the shower, while I'm making my bed.  But you cannot swallow it, not even a drip of it, it has to come out of you.  
</p><p>
It's a great way to keep your healthy flora nice. It's anti-microbial, anti-bacterial.  It's going to reach down, draw toxins out from places you couldn't possibly get at. It's one of the best ways that I know of to maintain health, AND it makes your teeth whiter.  Do a before and after.  
</p><p>
That's my 2-Minute Health Tip of the day!  Go ahead and enjoy your oil pulling and let me know how it goes!  I want to know!
