<p class="lead">Ingredients:</p>
2 ½ c.	 raw almond butter<br>
1 ½ c.	 raw honey or coconut nectar<br>
2 c.	 raw cacao powder<br>
3 tb.	 raw maca powder<br>
pinch	 sea salt or Himalayan salt<br>
1-2 c.	 raw cacao nibs, shredded coconut, chopped almonds, or whatever you would like to roll them in...<br><br>
Combine the first 5 ingredients in a bowl. Mix thoroughly, so that the mixture becomes a smooth, fairly firm dough. Scoop out little balls, roll them between your hands so they are nice and round, and roll in your topping of choice... Makes 35-40 truffles.
