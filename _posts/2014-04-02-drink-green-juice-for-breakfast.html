<p>Good Morning!  It's Lisa Wilson with The Raw Food Institute.  I'm here at the Raw Living Expo with co-founder Nathan Crane.  He's also the founder of Panacea Publishing. He's here to deliver his 2-Minute Health tip of the day. So... go Nathan!</p>

<p>My 2-Minute Health tip of the day is to start your morning with a fresh, half gallon, 32-ounce OR full gallon of green juice. This is what I do every single morning.  It doesn't have to be the whole thing green juice, you can have a buffer, like almond mylk for example. What I do is I take about 2/3 to 3/4 of a gallon, and I make fresh almond mylk, which is almonds and water.  Then I juice cucumber, celery, parsley and kale, and I mix it together and that's my breakfast from about 7:30 in the morning until about noon or 1 p.m.  It just nourishes my body, gives me so much energy, and it helps me feel light.  So start your morning with a green juice and you will feel amazing throughout the day.  - Nathan Crane</p>
