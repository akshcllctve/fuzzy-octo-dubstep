<h4>Here is my recipe:</h4><br>
<p class="well">
<strong>Lisa Wilson's Holiday Salad</strong><br><br>
<strong>1 or 2 fennel bulbs:</strong>  Slice the white fennel bulb into long, thin slices.  Cut the thin green tops that look like dill off and set aside for garnish.<br>
<strong>2 purple onion:</strong>  Slice into long, thin slices.<br>
<strong>5 oranges:</strong>  Cut into long thin slices, or pinwheels and them quarter your pinwheels to make bite size pieces.<br>
<strong>4 pomegranate:</strong>  Peel and seed to toss into this salad.<br>
<strong>Dressing:</strong>  Organic, cold pressed olive oil.<br><br>
Adjust the amounts above to suit your palate and preferences. Crack some mineral salt, such as Celtic or Himalayan and pepper over this salad to enhance the flavor. Serve and watch your guests go crazy for this dish!  <br>
</p>

People will be bugging you all night for the recipe, so you might want to print them on holiday cards ahead of time, as a party gift!</p>

The antioxidant power of this salad is off the charts with this powerful combination of foods.  Onions are incredible internal cleansers.  They are anti-viral and anti-microbial.  The rich color in the pomegranates offer an incredible antioxidant boost that will leave you energized and your cells singing for joy this holiday season.  They are one of the top foods you can eat for nutritional density on the ORAC scale, so enjoy.  Of course, oranges are a wonderful natural source of vitamin C.  Fennel is in the Umbellefereae family.  Therefore is related to parsley, carrots, coriander and dill, all known to be good detoxifiers with the ability to eradicate free radicals.  It is a potent source of vitamin C, and potassium.  </p>
