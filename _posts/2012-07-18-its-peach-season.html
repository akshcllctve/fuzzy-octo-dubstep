<p>Did you know that the early Chinese have known the benefits of peaches for centuries? Yes, it's often referred to as the "longevity peach." Meaning, that it helps to extend life! The PIT has often been used for medication. Makes perfect sense to me, since the same is true of the apricot pit. It's medicinal value is completely over the top!</p>

<p>Peaches or berries? Favorite? I just can't decide!</p>

<p>That means decadent desserts can not be made with this fruit we call a peach! SO VERY YUM!</p>

<p>Peaches are a great source of potassium. Have fatigue, anxiety, poor memory, muscle weakness, arrhythmia, vibration in your ears or even heart deterioration? EAT A PEACH FOR POTASSIUM! Low potassium can cause a laundry list of diseases, and the peach is packed with potassium power!</p>

<p>Natural forms of vitamin A are also critical for our bodies. And YES.... peaches are also packed with beta-carotene, which the body can then convert to vitamin A!!! Studies indicate that people with adequate vitamin A levels have a lower risk for cataracts. How great!</p>

<p>Peaches also contain lycopene and lutein. There are several studies and indications that these two substances, can help prevent macular degeneration, cancer and heart disease. YEAH!</p>

<p>Did I mention vitamin C yet? We all know oranges are packed with vitamin C, but did you know that peaches are too? It's true! Vitamin C is absolutely necessary to keep the immune system in top shape! Vitamin C will help you fight off viruses and other invaders on a daily basis! Put on your boxing gloves and fight that stuff with lots of natural vitamin C!</p>

<p>You want to know about fiber? Yes.... fiber too!!! This fiber is acting like little scrubbers in the intestinal walls of your colon. A clean colon can increase the amount of nutrients your body can absorb. You ALWAYS want a clean colon---not a filthy one!</p>

<p>So in summary peaches are FANTASTIC for:</p>

<ul><li>vision</li>
<li>skin</li>
<li>cancer prevention</li>
<li>immunity</li>
<li>stomach disorders</li>
<li>&amp; more</li></ul>
