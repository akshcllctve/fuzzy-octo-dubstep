<h2>Morning smoothies</h2>
<p>Here is how I like to start the morning sometimes, it takes  2 oranges, peeled, almond mylk (see my note below), cinnamon, maca (Maca has long been used to increase stamina and combat fatigue, from the Andes ), vanilla, chaga (a mushroom with medicinal properties) , 1/3 frozen banana &amp; some ice. Blend, pour into a glass  &amp; enjoy!<br>

<p style="text-align: left;">Making almond mylk is easy!</p>

<p><ul>
	<li>You need a blender, some straining tools (cheese cloth), a second finer mesh strainer (fine muslin bag) for your second pass and a bowl.</li>
	<li>  a cup of almond nuts to 3 cups of water.  A pound of nuts makes about a half gallon of almond mylk</li>
	<li>Soak over night and blend a cup at a time or so.</li>
</ul></p>
