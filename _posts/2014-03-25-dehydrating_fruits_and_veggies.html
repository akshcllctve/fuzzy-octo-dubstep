<p>These recipes can be applied to any fruit or vegetable.  Please note that if it is organic and applicable leave the skin on as that is where all of the nutrients are!  Below are some of my favorite and unique fruits and vegetables to dehydrate.  Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Dried Kiwi</h2>
<p>I thought I would share this as people tend to forget about the kiwi when dehydrating fruit.  I think it’s because we never see dehydrated kiwi for sale in the stores so it never occurred to me to dehydrate it.  Of course we dehydrate the standard fruits like pineapple, mango and banana but kiwi is such a hit with the kids I hope you all try it!</p>




<p class="lead">1.  Peel skin off kiwi </p>
<p class="lead">2.  Slice with a knife on a cutting board</p>

<p class="lead">3.  Spread the kiwi on dehydrator trays.</p> 
<p class="lead">5.  Dehydrate on 105 degrees for about 12 hours, or until crisp.</p>
<p class="lead">5.  Store in an airtight container. </p>




<h2>Apple Cinnamon Chips</h2>

<p>These are another big hit with the kids.  I like to send them in school lunches.  When apple season comes around and we have bags of local apples from the orchard I like to make huge batches of these.  They last so long you really can’t go wrong.  </p>


<p class="lead">1.  Core the apple and slice with a knife on a cutting board or a mandoline (leave skin on if organic!)</p>
<p class="lead">2.  Sprinkle with Cinnamon </p>

<h2>Sweet Potato Chips</h2>
<p>These are fabulous!  They are such a hit at The Raw Food Institute.  We serve these with our raw sun burgers along with some raw pickles.  Can’t beat it! </p>

<p class="lead">1.  Wash sweet potatos</p>
<p class="lead">2.  Use the mandolin slicer on the smallest setting or a vegetable/potato peeler to make super thin slices of potato--almost translucent. (leave skin on if organic!)</p>
<p class="lead">3.  In a large bowl, mix potatoes with 2 Tbs olive oil and salt.</p>
<p class="lead">4.  Spread in an almost-single layer on your dehydrator trays.</p>
<p class="lead">5.  Dehydrate on 105 degrees for about 12 hours, or until crisp.</p>
<p class="lead">6.  Store in airtight container.</p>
