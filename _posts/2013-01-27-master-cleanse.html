<p>The Master Cleanse is a modified fast that permits the use of lemon, maple syrup and cayenne pepper.</p>

<p>Lisa's modified version:</p>
<ul><li>7am 1tbsp epsom salt in warm water</li>
<li>8am get clean tea through day, blended in VM, lemon with seeds, pith &amp; 1/4 of the skin still on, 1 tsp maple syrup, pinch cayenne pepper, water...</li>
<li>9pm calming bed time tea, I will also add some green juices.</li></ul>

<p>I'll do this until my body says stop. Last time: 5 days of feeling fantastic! p.s.: This is not for everyone. Consult your health professional before doing this, or any cleanse...</p>
