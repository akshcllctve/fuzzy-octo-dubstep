<h3>Words can not describe this transformational week...!</h3>
<p><em>RFI participant yesterday: Day 4 of detox week: already wearing a different belt, and feeling amazing. He said yesterday he went home with such excitement and was sharing with his wife all that he has learned in classes so far (cultured vegetables, wheat grass, sprouting, conscious communication, healing circle, EMF's, essential oils, hormonal balance, body detox, green juice therapy etc.) He said his wife wept with tears and said, "I'VE BEEN WAITING 5 YEARS TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU." HAPPINESS!</em>!</p>

<p>It was amazing~! We also had a new, amazing space! There was sooo much room to move about. It was really great! Enhanced the whole experience!!</p>

<p>This session past participants who have healed in a major way with raw food/green juice, came in and shared their inspirational journeys with new students. One woman, with tears rolling down her face, expressed that because of her new raw lifestyle, her fibromyalgia pain has gone from a 10(being the worst) to a 3. She said, because of this, she is back living in this world. Hearing this brings me incredible happiness. That's what it's all about! :))))
I hope you can join us for a week sometime!</p>
