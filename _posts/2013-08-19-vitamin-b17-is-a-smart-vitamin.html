PLANT INTELLIGENCE! EXPLORING LAETRILE, OR Vitamin B17...<br>
Chemotherapy &amp; other drugs drugs do not know the difference between healthy cells &amp; unhealthy cells. Chemo will destroy everything in its path. But plants.... plants have wisdom. Let's use B17, or Laetrile as just one example. B17 is found in the seeds of apricot kernels, apple seeds, cherry seeds, plums, nectarines and many more.<br>
**"BUT THESE SEEDS CONTAIN CYANIDE! "<br>
Let's examine: These seeds contain only healthy, organic cyanide, not "inorganic" cyanide, which is deadly.
Historically, civilizations at the whole fruit--including the seed which is rich in nitrilosides, or laetrile.</p>

<p>B17 is a 'SMART' VITAMIN. Only cancer cells possess the key, that 'unlocks' the cyanide. A process called selective toxicity.</p>

<p>There is remarkable research on this topic &amp; good solid evidence.</p>

<p>I blend 4 daily, with 1/2 tsp curcumin or turmeric, 4 ounces of water &amp; a dash of cinnamon &amp; a dash of cayenne. In a healing crisis, one would do more.</p>
