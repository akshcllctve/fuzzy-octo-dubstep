Me too...</p>
<p>Did you know that activated charcoal powder is edible? Some people will mix it with water, to get relief from tummy aches in less than 30 minutes. In the holistic community, it is often used as a detoxifying agent, as it will grab onto free radicals and escort them out of your body.So what can it do for your skin?This activated charcoal will draw oil &amp; dirt from the pores, and yet it will not clog the skin! Great for those of us who are still acne prone!</p>


<p>Harsh cleansers will rob the skin of your natural oils &amp; can actually make the skin appear worse than it actually is!</p>

<p>Natural charcoal:</p>

<ul><li>1. Powerful, natural cleanser</li>

<li>2. Eliminates dirt &amp; oil that clog pores</li>

<li>3. Helps heal acne, and blackheads</li>

<li>4. Can help eliminate body odor</li>

<li>5. Gives the skin a smooth &amp; toned look</li></ul>

<p>After just 2 weeks of using this, I've noticed an immediate difference in my skin.</p>

<p>I purchased at one of my favorite all ~ natural stores, called LUSH. Their products are organic &amp; hand made. I chose the mask, not the soap. I wanted to try just the charcoal &amp; avocado mask, with no added soap. The name is: BLACK ANGEL. It's working!</p>

<p>You can make your own masks at home, if you like.</p>

<p>TELL ME IF YOU PUT CHARCOAL ON YOUR FACE TOO!</p>
