You know I'm crazy for green juice, right? Scott ferments the organic veggies, then juices and bottles them. Do you know how over the top medicinal this is...? Oh, and ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT TOO??? I'm a fan of his super root, and super green.... Seriously one of the best things I've run across....EVER!!!!!!! Yeah Scott!!</p>
