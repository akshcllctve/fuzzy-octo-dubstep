Result: Freshest all natural food mask I've EVER had, and maybe the nicest thing I've ever done for my skin. 1/3 cucumber peeled and blended w/ 2 tbsp water, 1 tsp chlorella, 1 tsp bentonite clay. Spread on face: leave for 20-30 minutes. Soothing &amp; naturally detoxifying. Smells like a garden! What do you do with the left over blended cucumber? ADD CHLORELLA, AND DRINK A NIGHT CAP, OF COURSE! WHAT ELSE? ;))Â  I think I'll get about 4 masks out of one fresh batch!</p>
