<p>I sometimes indulge in this raw breakfast of sprouted buckwheat, sprouted pepitos, chia seeds, help seeds, walnuts, goji berries and some fresh fruit--here green apple, but berries are fantastic. Delicious start to the day!</p>

<p>Always soak all seeds , especially the chia seeds to avoid constipation.</p>
