<p>Hi! You've asked, and we are delivering!  </p>
<p>

Hi Washington DC, we are coming to your area this September.  We haven't done this for years actually, and the reason I like people to come through a full 7-day detox is because to know, and not to do is not to know.
</p>
<p>
What does that mean?  It means until you experience what it feels like to be fully and 100% raw for a full week on a therapeutic, medicinal raw program you can't exactly know what it feels like.  You're going to go through some struggles as you detoxify before you get to the bliss.  BUT!
</p>
<p>
I hear you.  Some of you can't get away for 7 full days, so Washington DC we're coming there Sept. 26, 27 and 28th.  You can register for this weekend, the cost is $997 by calling (888) 799-9147 or visit <a href="http://therawfoodinstitute.com/bootcamp.html">our website </a>where you can register online.
</p>
<p>
Here's what we've done, we've packed this weekend with all of our core classes.  So you are still going to get: Dehydration, Digestive Wellness, Fermentation, Green Juice Therapy - the one that people line up around the block to hear.  You're going to get Why Raw?.  What is the science behind it?  Who are the original doctors and why in the heck would you want to go raw in the first place.
</p>
<p>
All of our core classes, like we've said we are just loading these three days up, so your head is going to kind of spin, it's going to be ALOT of information. But you are going to leave with all the tools so you can go home and roll yourself into a therapeutic medicinal raw program because EVERYBODY needs this information. We need it for prevention, we need it for detox.  We need it so we aren't getting these diseases for decades to come, so we need to know Sprouting 101, Sprouting 102. We need to know how to make wheatgrass juices and how to make energy soups, and how to make a therapeutic green juice.  How to make you roll this into a day, so all that, seriously ALL THAT, it is RIDICULOUS.  
</p>
<p>
I hope you've been following our website because you can see ridiculous testimonials.  People are now flying from around the world.  We just had a woman from our last retreat from Perth Australia. She flew 36 hours to be with us and she couldn't have been more happy with the program.  
</p>
<p>
Again, we are just knocking ourselves out bringing you the best, cutting edge information so that you can take this to your families and your communities and do your best as well AND if you want to become a Certified Raw Food Educator, usually we require 56 hours of hands-on training through our 7-Day Live Immersion Program BUT, we are going to allow you, if you take the 3-Day course to do that as well.  
</p>
<p>
This is really crazy, we haven't done this in years and have no plans to do it again, it's a 1-time thing.  So REGISTER!  We would love to see you there Sept. 26, 27 and 28th.  We are going to have a BLAST! 
</p>
<p>
Bring your friends, and I will see you in Washington DC!
