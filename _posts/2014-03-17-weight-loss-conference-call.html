Hi there it's Lisa Wilson with The Raw Food Institute.  Look out the window.. snow.  But guess what? Spring is right around the corner and that means bikini season ~  and everyone wants to know... what can I do to cleanse? To LOOK better, to FEEL better and really feel AMAZING this summer, so here's what we've decided to do. We've had a lot of people that have lost weight.  What is the number one topic in America? It's weight loss, and we have a lot of people who come through The Raw Food Institute and just start shedding the pounds, shedding the toxins and feeling better.  So we are going to get a number of them on a call with us.  It's going to be Sunday, March 23 2014 at 7 p.m. eastern.  </p>

<p>I think that you will want to hear their stories, because these people who have struggled, literally their whole life with weight, and after they came through The Raw Food Institute a light bulb went on and they, and I'm not talking about people who lost weight in a week, because that happens to almost everybody.  I'm talking about people who left, put this into their life, and have kept the weight off.  Those are the people that we are going to talk to, and their lives have completely changed because of their experience at The Raw Food Institute. </p>
<p>
I want you to hear it from them, because weight is a really big deal.  I know personally myself, at one point in my life I was 40 pounds bigger than I am now.  So I feel healthier, stronger, more fit at age 44, than i did in my early 20s.
</p>
<p>So we are going to tap into their brains and deliver some of their healthy messages to you . So tun in Sunday, March 23 at 7 p.m.  We will see you there!</p>
<p>Warmly,</p>
<p>Lisa Wilson</p>
