Hi there, welcome to my kitchen! I want to talk briefly today about this little nut called a Brazil nut.  I LOVE Brazil nuts because their delicious, but also because they are packed with selenium.  Now when I was going through a healing crisis when my thyroid blew up, and I had way overactive thyroid called graves disease and I started doing research, the number one mineral that I was deficient in was: selenium.  I started eating brazil nuts as if it was a supplement every single day of my life. I literally kept this bottle next to my supplement bottles.  Now the beautiful thing about Brazil nuts is that the selenium is the real form of selenium.  I mean it's not synthetic, it's not concocted in a lab, your body knows exactly what to do with it.  It's so important for the thyroid, for thyroid support.  There are particular nutrients that we really need for cancer prevention for thyroid health, and they are selenium, zinc, potassium and magnesium.  Those are the four most important minerals that we are missing.  Again, Brazil nuts are rich in selenium.  The beautiful thing is 3 Brazil nuts a day, that's all you need. </p>

<p>So, I'm just going to chop these into my salad.  If you are making a cooked green for example, if you are in a transition and you are eating more cooked greens, maybe you can't digest some of these raw foods yet, you can absolutely add this to some cooked greens as well.  So add it to your brocolli, to your kale.  But right now I'm going to put this right into my green salad.  Again, 3 Brazil nuts a day is all you need for that thyroid support, for that maximum amount of selenium.  So just give it a chop... and that's it.  One of the most ridiculously easy nutrients to get into your body, AND it's delicious.</p>

<p>And that's my 2-Minute Health Tip of the day.  See you next time,</p>
