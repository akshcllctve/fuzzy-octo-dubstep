<p class="lead">I'm often asked how I stay on track with my diet and lifestyle?</p>

<p>I keep momentum based on how I feel. I know anytime i get just a wee bit off track, I feel lousy.  I can tell you I was just away on vacation for a few days at a friends house, and the food was not the way I prepare food at home.  Literally 24 hours after eating that way, I felt awful.  When your body starts to be really clean and then you put foods in it that are compromising, even a little bit, your body will keep you on track by telling you you are on the wrong path.  It knows what is working for you.  So you start to feel so good all the time, you forget how feeling bad feels, unless you get a little bit off, and that's going to bring you right back.  Because feeling bad, feels really bad! And because you don't go there very often you forget how that feels. </p>
<p> So I stay on track just because I feel SO GOOD!!!! I stay on track because I can keep up with my kids.  I stay on track because I am an active mom.  I mean I'm 44 years old and this year I took up gymnastics!  That's the life I want to live, I want to keep going, I want to get better in my 40s, my 50s, my 60, my 70s, and my 80s. I want to live really well and I want to feel good the whole time I'm doing it.</p>
