<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2281" style="margin: 4px;" alt="wheatgrass" src="http://therawfoodinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Grassroots2.jpg.w300h225.jpg" width="300" height="225" />Spend as little as $1 - $2 per week to have your very own wheatgrass juice at home.  All you need is a separate wheatgrass juicer.  You can grow wheatgrass INDOORS, in a planting tray, flower pot, cup, etc... without mold no matter where you live in the world.  I do suggest always growing wheatgrass in soil rather than hydroponically (no soil).  Growing indoors or outdoors doesn't change the actual grass itself. </span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">To begin, you will need some growing trays...  </span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">There are the small trays, which are 10"x10" use approx 1 cup (½ pound) of seed and will yield up to 10 ounces of juice.  Or there are the large trays, which are 17"x17", use up to 2 cups (one pound) of seed and will yield up to 20 ounces of juice per tray.  The large trays should produce almost 2 pounds of wheatgrass. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;"> One pound of wheatgrass = approx. 12 ounces of juice when using the Healthy Juicer.</span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;"> Don't forget that you can grow wheatgrass in a flower pot as well, or any other container that will hold some soil in it ... some soil of any kind: potting mix, top soil, potting soil, (FYI: at times, organic compost in a bag may be too acidic and your wheat seeds will not grow as well.
</span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: small;">The basics to get you started:</span></span></span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">          </span>
1. Soak your hard winter wheat seed (also called wheatberries, please stop calling them berries, they are SEEDS!  thanks!) overnight or 8-12 hours.  Hard spring wheat will also work, however, at times, the winter wheat is a better choice.  They are the same seed, just harvested at the farm a different time of the year.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">2. Sprout the seed in a jar for the next 16-24 hours, rinsing the seed well three times a day, before work, after work &amp; before bed or before school, after school and before bed... some of you may have gotten that joke and are laughing right now!!</span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">
3. Plant the seed after a very short "tail" is visible, on top of the soil (basic potting mix or top soil will work fine, peat moss is an important ingredient to look for in your soil.  If you have to add peat moss the mix is 1 part peat moss/3parts soil) filled half-way up the tray.  Do not bury the seeds under the soil.  But you will need to cover them up to keep them wet. </span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">
4. Water tray, heavily but gently, once in the morning and then cover seed to keep from drying out for the first three days.  Another tray can be used that will go right on top of the seed, either empty or full with soil (you won't hurt the seeds), or a black piece of plastic.  The cover is to keep the seeds wet.</span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">
5. During the first three days of growth, water once a day, heavy but gentle, in the am and really soak the soil (when the tray drips it's a good sign you are watering enough) and then lightly mist your seed in the pm, before bed (lift cover off to mist seed). </span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">
6. On the fourth day, uncover grass (roots should begin to take over your soil), water heavily once a day and keep the grass in the shade (never direct sunlight).  If you can 'see' in the room where you are growing and do not have to turn on a light, then there is plenty of light for your grass to green up.  In the winter months, if you have to keep the grass inside a room where there are no windows, you may just have to change the light bulbs in that room to full / wide spectrum lights.  Leave them on as the sun would be out.  Visit <a href="http://www.ottlite.com/">www.ottlite.com</a> for more details on these lights.</span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">
7. For mold problems, increase your air circulation with a fan or A/C to keep temp between 60-80 degrees.  Please also visit the 'FAQ' link and read all about MOLD and Wheatgrass.  I have the answers you are looking for!  Trust me!!</span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">
8. Harvest grass when a second blade of grass appears or when the grass 'splits / joints' toward the bottom of the blade (average growing time is 7-12 days depending on the weather, but still always watch for the second blade of grass as you can never judge by how many days it has been growing or how tall the grass is).  A pair of scissors works great to cut the grass.  Harvest really low and right above the seed.  <em>*Remember it is always better to harvest your wheatgrass sooner rather than later!!  The older it gets, the more bitter it tastes.  Read the blog at 'Michael's Blog' link.</em></span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">
9. Only harvest one time... that cut grass will store in the fridge for up to 7 - 14 days.  Use the 'green bags' (coming soon for sale in our store) and be sure that your fridge is cold, 38-40 degrees.  Once you harvest, then start process all over again with new seed and soil.  It will grow back a second time, however, it will have lost 50-75% of it's nutritional value.  Wheat is an annual seed, so the first growth is the one you want.  The second can be given to your animals!!!  (Or as an implant! and again, some of you are now laughing!!)  </span>
