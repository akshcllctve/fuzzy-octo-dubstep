<p>Before I went raw I baked my kale chips and was totally addicted. When I went raw and was searching high and low for an alternative. Then came the kale craze in stores. Kale chips everywhere. I still couldn’t find one to satisfy my taste. The reason, I discovered, is I like TONS of topping on my kale chips. So I started making my own.</p>
<p>I make these with any kind of kale, dinosaur kale, green kale or purple kale. The only difference is the texture, the taste is the same. I find the purple and green kale to be fluffier than the dinosaur kale. I LOAD the creamy ‘cheesy’ topping on each and every bit of the kale. Then I discovered that I could do the same thing with onions and was I in heaven. Kale and onion chips are one of my go­-to snacks.</p>
<p>I like to make kale and onion chips at the same time because the recipe is the exact same. I just double the recipe. I always seem to have extra onions and kale laying around so we have these at our house all of the time.</p>
