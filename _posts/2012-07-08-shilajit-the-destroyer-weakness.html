Shilajit   is a substance mainly found in the Altai, Himalaya, and Caucasus mountains of Central Asia.  It is used in Ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine (It’s name means “nectar of God”).    It has been reported to contain at least 85 minerals in ionic form, as well as triterpenes, humic acid and fulvic acid.

I enjoy shilajit almost daily in my tea!!! This is an excellent educational video about what it is and does. ~LOVE
