<p class="lead">When the weather is nice at The Raw Food Institute, we are on the move.  These photos are from a hike we took together in July.  We hiked the Heublein Tower. The views are spectacular and the conversations are even better.</p>

<p class="lead">No time?  5 Tips to get you moving!</p>

<h3>1.)  Set a project alarm.  </h3>

<p class="lead">When you are working on a task on your computer, set a time limit.  Say 30 minutes, or 50 minutes.  First this gives you a deadline to work within and second this gives you permission to get UP and move when that timer goes off.  Studies prove that people are more focused when they work within a time limit.  At the end, you must move.  Get up and do some squats, hop on your rebounder or go for a 7 minute walk.  You will come back fresh.

<h3>2.)  Have a case of "snooze-button-itis"?   </h3>

<p class="lead">Set your alarm for the latest possible time you can get out of bed.  This allows for higher quality sleep and you can not be tempted to hit the snooze button.  </p>

<h3>3.)  Put your gym time on the calendar and honor that time, like all other appointments.  </h3>

<p class="lead">I like to show up for classes at my gym.  This gets me there at a set time.  Plus, the peer pressure thing is highly effective.  Once you are there, your mood enhancing brain hormones kick in.  At the end of a work out, you will never hear yourself say, "Gee, I wish I really had not done that."  </p>

<h3>4.)  Can you walk or ride your bicycle to your local store, library or any other daily destinations?  Then do!  I ride a bicycle to my gym whenever I can.  It gets me in nature daily.   It improves my health and peace of mind.</h3>

<h3>5.)  Put a big event on your calendar like a 5k, a mud run or a long bicycle ride.  </h3>

<p class="lead">With that event coming up, you will have to stay active!</p>

<p class="lead">After you do this and stick to it, you will be happy with your results.  You will like the way you feel, you will like how well your clothes fit and it will spill over into everything you do.  You will just be happier!</p>
