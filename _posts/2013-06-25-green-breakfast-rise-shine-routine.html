Get up, prepare a green breakfast, with some kind of healthy fat. 2.) Pack power lunch: Always a salad, of some variety to put in their lunch boxes. Add snacks (pieces of fruit) &amp; spring water. Salad usually has: sprouts, leaves, sometimes a fruit, goji berries, &amp; seeds or nuts such as hemp, sesame, sunflower, pumpkin, brazil, walnut, almond, jungle peanut etc. This is usually topped with a home made vinaigrette, such as fresh garlic, ginger, EVOO, ACV or lemon juice. 3.) Off they go to catch the bus! (((BTW: Never sick &amp; not a cavity among the 3--&amp; never, ever had fluoride in water, paste or gel.)))
