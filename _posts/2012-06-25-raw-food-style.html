<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1723" style="margin: 4px;" title="light lunch at The Raw Food Institute" src="http://therawfoodinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/light_lunch-300x300.jpg" alt="light lunch at The Raw Food Institute" width="300" height="300" />A nice light lunch helps keep me energized and focused. Something heavy might just put me to sleep. Too much to do for that, so today I'll go with the lite bites of nutrients! Perfect to keep me going all afternoon!  Raw Food Style.</p>

<p>These are endive boats with seed "meat" and veggies. Super yum! Fill me up, without weighing me down!  I enjoy that with my green juice.</p>

<p>In Vitamix, combine sunflower seeds, cashews, red pepper, juice of one or 2 lemons.  If you like a cheesy taste, you can also add nutritional yeast.  You will need a total of about 3 cups of raw cashews &amp; sunflower seeds.  Refrigerate the left overs &amp; enjoy for one week.</p>

<p>Green juice I'm enjoying today:  celery, cucumber, pea shoots, lime, collard greens.  Juice &amp; enjoy!</p>
