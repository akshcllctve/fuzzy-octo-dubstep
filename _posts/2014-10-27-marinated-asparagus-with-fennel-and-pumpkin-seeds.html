<p class="lead">This recipe makes a wonderful side dish for any raw meal.  I like to pair this with the zucchini pasta and creamy red pepper sauce recipe for that real Italian feel.  </p><p class="lead">

Pumpkin seeds are fabulous for you - they have amino acids and unsaturated fatty acids, contain many B vitamins, as well as C, D, E and K. They also have wonderful minerals like calcium, potassium, phosphorous and niacin.  Feel free to much on these all day long! </p>


<p class="well"><strong>Marinated Asparagus & Fennel with Pumpkin Seeds
</br></br>
Yield: 2-3 servings<br><br>

15	asparagus spears, woody ends removed<br>
3/4	cup	thinly sliced fennel bulb<br>
1-2	Tbs	fresh lemon juice<br>
1 tsp	extra virgin olive oil<br>
sea salt, to taste<br>
2-3	Tbs	Italian pumpkin seeds (see recipe below)<br><br>

Method:<br>
1. In a bowl or plate, marinate the asparagus and fennel in the lemon juice, olive oil, and sea salt. The longer the vegetables are allowed to marinate, the more tender they will be. You can also warm them and expedite the process of tenderizing by putting them in the dehydrator for a few hours.<br>
2. Once marinated, serve and top with the seasoned (or plain if you like) pumpkin seeds.
