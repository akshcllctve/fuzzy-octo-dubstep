<p class="lead">You have to get the chemicals out and the healthy food in.</p>

<p>When that starts to happen your mind starts to get TURNED ON! You start to get turned on to things you want to do with your life. It's so easy to just sort of grab the package off the shelf that says healthy, I know, I used to be guilty of that.  When I had children, that's what made the difference for me. I knew that I was responsible for these little beings, and I knew that the outcome of their life would be completely different based on what I put into their body.  As a mother I took that responsibility very seriously.  That's when I started to change and at that point in time I didn't know...was dairy good for you or bad for you? Was soy good? Was it bad? So those were questions that I had to learn, then I had to get out there and start teaching because what I found was so powerful.</p>

<p>Once you start to get the chemicals out, and you start  to get the good food into your body, everything changes. You start to feel better. You start to feel happier. Your whole life will change based on what you put in your body.</p>
