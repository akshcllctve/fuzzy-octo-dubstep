Want to know WHY I started The Raw Food Institute? Years ago, I was working at NIHA (largest integrative medical practice on the east coast). My clients had deep health challenges. I began using raw foods, sticking only to superior raw &amp; medicinal raw principles (what we teach at RFI). The results were unheard of &amp; remarkable. Word spread like wildfire. I had more clients than I could possibly manage &amp; I was seeing clients from 7am, sometimes to 9pm. It was sort of an insane time! I HAD to start The Raw Food Institute. Sort of like it was my destiny. We are in our 4th year now &amp; have quickly become an international destination, because of our outstanding reputation. People fly in from around the world. This year, we won: 1. Best Raw Vegan Retreat Center 2. Medical Awareness for Raw Foods. I love the study of plants. I love it when people gain their health again &amp; I love it when people can actually live the life they were destined to life. I love what I do &amp; find it completely rewarding!
