Happy Fall Everyone! Isn’t is amazing how 2011 is flying by!

I have to say one thing, launching The Raw Food Institute this year has been one of the best things I’ve ever done!

The results I’m seeing in everything from weight loss, cancer, diabetes, and more is mind blowing!

Just Like Don C., who <strong>DRASTICALLY</strong> lowered his blood sugar numbers and lost a whopping <strong>16lbs</strong> during the RFI Week:

He also gained energy, knowledge, and inspiration for him and his wife! Don’s blood sugar was between 289-400 when he came to The Raw Food Institute and by the end of the week his blood sugar was down to 89-139!

Stories like Don’s, and other RFI grads who have lowered their blood sugar numbers, are the reason we’re dedicating The Raw Food Institute January Program to Diabetes RESULTS!

What did Don have to say to others after his amazing week? He said, “You owe it to your body and you owe it to yourself.”

January 2012’s Raw Food Institute Immersion at NIHA will focus on using raw food to help change blood sugar numbers by incorporating nourishing, satisfying raw food and advanced detox techniques.

Our upcoming program dates are:

<strong>January 15-21, 2012</strong>

<strong>April 15-21, 2012</strong>

<strong>June 24-30, 2012</strong>
