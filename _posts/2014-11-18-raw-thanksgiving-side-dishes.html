<p class="lead">Both of these dishes are so easy and delicious.  What a great way to add raw into your Thanksgiving Day!  I intended to add a sweetener to the cranberry sauce but I tried it first and I loved the flavor without any added sweetener.  Feel free to add a date or some raw honey if it is too sour for you.</p>
