<p>Determined to go a natural educated path an alkaline lifestyle became paramount. Along with alkaline water, alkaline foods were a must.</p>

<p>Thank goodness my journey led me to Lisa Wilson and the Raw Food Institute. I enrolled in the 7 Day Emersion and educator programs in October 2011 and have never looked back.</p>

<p>I juice every day and follow a mostly raw diet.</p>
