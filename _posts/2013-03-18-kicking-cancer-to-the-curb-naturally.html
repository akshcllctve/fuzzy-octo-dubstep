Elaine Gibson's story.

This is the first cancer survivor interview in the 6 part series by Lisa Wilson of the Raw Food Institute.
<blockquote><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2399" style="margin: 4px;" alt="Elaine Gibson" src="http://therawfoodinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/547338_447098521984548_202462256_n-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" />In 2008 I was diagnosed with a recurrence and found myself in Stage IV Non Hodgkin’s Lymphoma!

Determined to go a natural educated path an alkaline lifestyle became paramount. Along with alkaline water, alkaline foods were a must.

Thank goodness my journey led me to Lisa Wilson and the Raw Food Institute. I enrolled in the 7 Day Emersion and educator programs in October 2011 and have never looked back.

I juice every day and follow a mostly raw diet.

Today I am 23 pounds lighter and wearing a size 2/4!! Best thing was that the weight loss was actually a surprise and not my main goal. Getting healthy and living a long life was at the top of my heart.

Working with Lisa and the Raw Food Institute has educated and supported my so today I know what to do and do it with the confidence that I am in control.</blockquote>
