<p>How to open a pomegranate, with ease:</p>

<p class="well">With a serrated knife, cut your pomegranate into quarters.  Have 2 bowls on hand and be sure to be wearing an apron, or something you do not care about staining.  These seeds are squirters.  One bowl is your discard bowl and one is for your precious seeds.  Once you have 4 quarters, you can begin popping the seeds into your seed bowl.  This bowl should be fairly deep, to catch all the jumpers and splashers.  Eat plain, or enjoy as part of a meal of dessert.  </p>
