<p>Hi it's Lisa Wilson with The Raw Food Institute bringing you your 2-Minute Health Tip of the day! </p>
<p>

Today I'm talking about gadgets.  Sometimes the simplest things in life make me the happiest.  This is by <a href="http://www.orthomolecularproducts.com/ProductDetails.aspx?id=4bcb4bdd-3ffc-49bb-83aa-329e9d1f5587">Orthomolecular products</a>, and I don't know what it's called. Lets call it the whizzer.  I'm just going to show you how I use it.</p>
<p>

What I love about this is sometimes the Vitamix, which I love, love, love is just too bulky, and I can't take it places.  So, this is what I use to go to the gym, this is my all natural orange drink I rejuvenate my cells with at the gym.  This is my protein green powder, made from pea protein and all kinds of other delicious, amazing greens.  This does not take place of the living green juices. This is some barley grass. And finally the last one I'm making is the reishi tea, this is The Raw Food Institute's blend of reishi, chaga, shilajit and ormus. Delicious. Great pick-me-up in the morning.  I'm going to put a little bit of almond milk in there.  I could put a little bit of raw honey or stevia.  </p>
<p>

Ok, now I'm going to show you the whizzer. So, just right into the orange drink, it's a little battery operated, and it just saves so much time.  You don't have to have the bulky Vitamix.  There you go, now the green drink.  ..And the Reishi tea.  Now I have my tea kettle of water, I'm going to add that, and it is sort of like a healthy latte in the morning, made of Reishi, chaga, shilajit and ormus, some of the medicinal mushrooms.  </p>
<p>

So is that cool or what?  I just wanted to show it to you, because just like I said I go through my day and I get simple pleasures from little things, and the whizzer, absolutely one of my simple little things.</p>
<p>

So that's your 2-Minute Health Tip for today, the whizzer! What's your favorite simple gadget? Share in the comments!</p>
