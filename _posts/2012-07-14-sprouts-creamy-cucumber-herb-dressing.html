<h2>Sprouts &amp; Creamy Cucumber Salad Recipe</h2>
<p>A great raw food recipe for the summer time with a light course of sprouts &amp; creamy cucumber.Â  The 'cream' comes from the almond mylk.</p>

<p>Blend about 2 inches of cucumber with some fresh almond mylk. Stir in chopped cucumber &amp; dried thyme. This one has no oil, but adding some hemp oil, or oo is optional! Serve on top of freshly clipped buckwheat &amp; sunflower sprouts! Enjoy!</p>
