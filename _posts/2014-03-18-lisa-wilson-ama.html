<p>Ask Me Anything! What am I talking about?</p>
<p> Hi! It's Lisa Wilson here at The Raw Food Institute. We were tossing around ideas at the office about what to talk about next and we thought: let's have a webinar on ask me anything! </p><p>Everything's fair game. If you wanna know what juicer and blender I use, if you wanna know what I eat for breakfast in the morning, if you want to know what kind of results we see at The Raw Food Institute, if you want to know what my kids eat.... Ask me anything!</p><p>So we are going to be doing that on <strong>Wednesday, the 26th of March at 7 p.m.</strong>  Tune in live!</p><p>Here's how this works.  I would like you to email your questions to info@therawfoodinstute.com OR leave them in the comments below OR ask me on facebook.  Then we are going to go through those, pick the ones that most people want to know and do an interview style webinar.  Jerry, who is on staff here is going to be asking me your questions, LIVE.  </p><p>So email me those questions!  I can't wait to hear from you! It's going to be a SUPER FUN night. </p><p>Wednesday, 7 o'clock, the 26th of March... See you then!  Ask Me Anything!</p>
