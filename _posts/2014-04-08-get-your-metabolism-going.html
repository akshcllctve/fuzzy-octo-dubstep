<p>Hi it's Lisa Wilson with The Raw Food Institute, here at the Raw Living Expo introducing Chris Whitcoe, and we are doing our 2-Minute Health tip of the day.  So Chris is here to share!</p>

<p>First thing you do, is when you get out of bed, think about what can I do to get my metabolism moving again.  It's better if you are going to - especially those of you who are looking to lose weight, I'm not looking to lose weight, I'm also looking to have energy and feel great.  This is a great tip to lose weight, have energy and feel great, and it's think about how to get your basic idling of your engine, if your car is idling at a faster idle, you're going to burn more fuel than if you race around for 20 minutes with an idle real low for the rest of the 24 hours. So what you want to do is think, when you wake up in the morning, how do I get my metabolism going?  So there's different ways, one of the best ways to go is to just get up out of bed, and start doing some stretching or doing some yoga to start getting the blood flowing, get your body moving.  That's going to get your metabolism going. Wake up your body.</p>
<p>What I like to do when I get out of bed is start doing push-ups in the morning.  So whatever you can do, start off with 10, get to 20, 30,100.  I do 100, but everyones at their own place.  The other thing you can do is maybe drink some water right away and hydrate.  I like to put in a little bit of chlorella powder, or a little bit of vitamin green.  Whatever those green vitamins are, get them in your blood.  Some people have done blood analysis, have told me, I've witnessed this, that just a little bit of chlorella will kind of make up the cells of the blood.  I imagine that happening when I drink my water, move my body, take a deep breath, get the cells going and think about how I get my metabolism running efficiently for the day. </p> -Chris Whitcoe
