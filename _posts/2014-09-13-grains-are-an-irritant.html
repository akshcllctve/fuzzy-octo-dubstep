<p>Porridge or cereal the best way to start the day?? --YES! If I'd like to be a drooling puddle napping at my desk by 10am, then it is perfect. </p>

**What do RAW FOOD Lifestyles and PALEO meal plans have in common? NO GRAINS. Both maintain healthy blood sugars, particularly when eating low fruit (about 10-15% of food daily for healthy individuals). After years of studying nutrition I've determined this: 
--After Chemicals, refined sugar and dyes (not even foods in my book, but abundantly in US food supply), grains are one of the biggest irritants. Wheat leads the way as the worst, gluten rich grains are 2nd and all the others come in 3rd. I'd even say that tubers (once with a horrible reputation, now recently being cleaned up and dusting off their reputations), are a much better carb choice than most grains. Recently, I heard Dr. William Davis speak. He said that he has now saved hundreds of people from having a piece of their colon removed surgically by simply removing wheat. Once wheat was removed, surgery was unnecessary. WHAT? Why doesn't everybody know this? Why are we still promoting whole wheat as health food? It is just not what it was 50+ years ago, due to significant agricultural changes.

Exceptions to this? Yes. You can technically sprout and eat raw wild rice, quinoa and buckwheat. These ancient grains (even properly prepared) and are not meant to be consumed daily in a raw menu plan. They are there for occasional variety, and can also satisfy food cravings for grains.

<p>
If you have a medical condition, consider an elimination diet, and put grains at the top of your list. 
</p>
<p>
How to do an elimination diet successfully: Remove the food you are testing 100%, for 14 days. On the 14th day, add this food back in abundantly. Write down your results. Look for things like moodiness, fatigue, restlessness, irritability, insomnia, rashes, bloating and all other physical and emotional changes. If you experience any of these symptoms, you have a sensitivity and your body is happiest without this. Your body knows best. Your body will not betray you!
