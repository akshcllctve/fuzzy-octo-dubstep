<p class="lead">People need to move their bodies. </p>

<p>We all are on computers, we use our brains and using the keyboards, but we're not using our bodies.  We  are not making the heart pound.  We're not moving the lymphatic system.  Moving our bodies is critical to health.  We need to pump the blood. We need to deliver oxygen to the cells in our body, so we need to get moving every single day. We need to take walks, we need to go biking.  We need to do things that are fun. </p>
<p>That's something that we really roll into our life around here.  You know, we live in a great area, we can take the bike paths four miles to town.  We ride our bikes to the pool.  Exercise is built into our lifestyle around here, it's just something that we do, and it's something you need to do too, because it's really important for families and individuals to be moving their bodies every single  day.</p>
