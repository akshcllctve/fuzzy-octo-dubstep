<p class="lead">Just Breathe.</p>

<p>If I could have people do just one thing for their health it would be to just breathe.</p>

<p>You know, we talk about changing our lifestyle and bringing all these healthy foods in, and the number one thing people forget to do is just breathe.  The thing that our bodies need the most is oxygen, we need to deliver oxygen to the cellular level, so the number one thing before everything else would be just to breathe.  Just take a deep breath in, and exhale. Just breathe.</p>
