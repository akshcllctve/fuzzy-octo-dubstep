<p class="lead">For the month of September I want to focus on healthy lunches.  We are all crazy busy with our jobs and if you are anything like our family running kids to school and activities can get crazy.  I want to show you that making lunches does not have to be time consuming.  
</p><p class="lead">
This nori roll recipe is the easiest recipe ever and you can get really creative with them by adding in almost anything!  Nori is loaded with minerals and is also a natural source of iodine which is difficult to find in most foods.  Once we add the fresh sprouts in we are talking about an over the top healthy easy lunch.

	<strong>Nori Rolls</strong><br><br>
<strong>
Untoasted Nori Sheets<br>
Marinated Mushrooms <br>
Olive Oil<br>
Coconut Aminos<br>
Lemon Juice<br>
Veggies like Avocado, Cucumbers, Daikon radish<br>
Pea Shoots or Sunflower Sprouts <br><br>

Method:<br></strong>
1. Marinate Mushrooms - Slice mushrooms and marinated for at least 20 mins with some olive oil, coconut aminos, lemon juice<br>
2. Cut veggies into thin strips<br>
3. Lay out a nori sheet <br>
4. Place mushrooms, strips of veggies and sprouts along one side. You can let some of the veggies stick out the sides for a nice presentation when they are cut.  <br>
6. Sprinkle with a dash of salty seasoning if you wish.  <br>
7. Wet the other side of the nori roll with your fingers and with both hands, roll the nori sheet around the veggies so that the roll rests on the side with the seam.  <br>
8. Allow to sit for a few minutes for the nori to soften and absorb some of the moisture from the veggies.  <br>
9. Slice into 6-8 pieces with a sharp knife<br><br>
