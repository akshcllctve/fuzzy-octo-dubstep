Last Thanksgiving, I was diagnosed (by 3 dr.s) with Graves disease, or extreme hyperthyroid which was confirmed by blood tests. It was suggested to me to do radioactive iodine pills (which BTW, cause cancer), or consider removing my thyroid. I had giant nodules on my thyroid that &amp; the inflammation was incredibly painful. I chose instead to visit Dr. Wong in NY and do the Berkson protocol of LDN &amp; ALA. Dr. Berkson has a track record of an 85% success rate with all auto immune disease. Incredible by ANY standard! By Christmas my thyroid was back to 'baby soft' normal! The recovery was so swift, even I was stunned! I continue to take chinese herbs, LDN &amp; ALA. Healthy thyroid still today!!!
