Here is my Green juice recipe I enjoy daily.  Remember to drink it slowly!  I believe a healthy kitchen needs to have both a juicer &amp; a high speed blender. There is absolutely no way to get the benefits of one 16 oz glass of straight up green juice from any other source on the planet! It is a miracle drink. That said, don't skip the fiber... eat plenty of fresh salads, sprouts etc. You can always make a veggie stock with your left over pulp!
