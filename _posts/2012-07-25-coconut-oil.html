I found my hair becoming dry, brittle &amp; thin. Not something any woman, or man, wants for their hair. I've been doing a deep condition with PURE COCONUT OIL once a week. I put it in my hair and sleep with it---towel required, of course. It has rejuvenated my hair! It no longer breaks, no more frizz &amp; it just looks healthier. WAY cheaper than a salon deep condition &amp; you are skipping the chemicals this way too. MY FAVORITE OTHER USES FOR COCONUT OIL: I shave my legs with it, brush my teeth with coconut oil &amp; neem oil, do oil pulling with it and of course I eat plenty of it. I've used it to bring up my cholesterol levels. They were dangerously low, which will throw off hormone levels. Because it is anti-bacterial &amp; anti-microbial it helps to keep me healthy all year long too. Central &amp; South America have know this secret for centuries. Did you know you can also put it on before going to the pool? Not only is it a sunscreen, it also will create a barrier which keeps chlorine off your skin.
I HAVE A MILLION REASONS TO LOVE COCONUT OIL.... WHY DO YOU LOVE COCONUT OIL??????
