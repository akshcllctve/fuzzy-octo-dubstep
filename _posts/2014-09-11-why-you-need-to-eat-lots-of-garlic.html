<p>How kissable are you? What, did I just say that?  I just said that!  How kissable are you? What am I talking about?  I'm talking about garlic because I can't stop talking about garlic because I LOVE garlic.  We all love garlic around my house. </p><p>



Why do I love garlic? Because it's the number 1 medicine in the world.  It's antimicrobial, antibacterial and can keep us all super duper healthy.</p><p>

So I'm holding a couple of things, I'll start by talking about this garlic supplement.  I get a lot of people through The Raw Food Institute that want to know how they can lower their blood pressure naturally.  Garlic!
</p><p>
If you've ever gone in for a surgery they say to you, don't take any garlic for a couple of days before because it is known to significantly lower your blood pressure.  I'm not suggesting this is medical advise, I'm suggesting that you talk to your doctor and see if a garlic supplement is right for you or not AND the cool thing about this is that body builders - if you know what they're doing - it's kind of like natural steroids. If you look at their protocol - alpha lipoic acid and garlic for lean muscle mass.  
</p><p>
So eat your garlic, and because it's anti-microbial and anti-bacterial you can drink it too!</p><p>

One of my photographers Michael sent me an email and said I have this lousy head cold, this flu and I can't get over it.  So I said do this: 1 clove garlic, twice that amount of ginger peeled.  Pop that in the  vitamix with a cup of water.  Whiz it 3-4 minutes until it's warm and drink!  This is a potent remedy.  He wrote me back and said "what are you trying to kill me?"  I said NO! I'm trying to make you better!
</p><p>
It just naturally goes up your sinus cavity and starts breaking everything up and goes right at those viruses, those bugs, those bad guys because again it's anti-microbial and anti-bacterial.
</p><p>
So, check it out, make yourself a cup of garlic-ginger tea, pick yourself up some supplements for some lean body mass.  If you've got high blood pressure consider it with your doctor to help lower your blood pressure. 
</p><p>
Maybe a little less stress would be good in your life too :)  So that's my 2-Minute Health Tip of the day, I'll see you next time!
