<p class="lead">During the month of October I will be focusing on the theme "Fall Food For You!"  I love this time of year and it is a great excuse for me to get in the kitchen and create seasonal recipes.  </p>
<p class="lead">
This week I have decided to share my go to cereal for busy mornings.  I like to make ahead and have for the entire week.  To spice it up I have created a Pumpkin Spice Pecan Mylk that is so delicious!  Pumpkins have over the top health benefits!  They are loaded with vitamins, carotenes and anti-oxidants and the list goes on.  Enjoy this recipe as the weather changes!</p>
