<p>This recipe is a no brainer for summer gatherings.  It's simple, healthy, filling, delicious and so colorful that if you are entertaining this impressive recipe is sure to wow your guests.  The best part is every single ingredient is a living food!</p>

<p>I am always looking for ways excuses to use different lettuce options in the store.  I saw some beautiful endive boats in the market and my creative juices started spinning.</p>

<p>In order to really take this recipe to the next level I decided to include our sprouted hummus recipe.</p>
