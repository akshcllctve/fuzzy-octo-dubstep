<p class="lead">Bounce your way to a squeaky clean lymphatic system!</p>

<p>This one is a ton of fun! Now we all know that the heart pumps the blood around the body and that's how we cleanse the blood, but what about the lymphatic system?  Well the lymph nodes and lymphatic system, we are responsible for cleaning, which means we have to go for a run, or get a massage or use a chi machine, or my personal favorite: the rebounder or mini-trampoline.</p>

<p>Now this is something that you don't want to tuck away or put under a bed somewhere because you probably won't use it!  So we keep ours right out here in the middle of the living room floor.  This is so important to move the lymphatic system, if you are a patient at the Gerson Institute, every single patient there, for three times a day, for three minutes must jump on the rebounder, and try this - even if your in a coma - meaning someone else will bounce you.  That's how important it is to move the lymphatic system.  It doesn't have to be a big movement, you don't have to try to reach the ceiling, it can be just a gently movement.</p>

<p>A lot of different things you can do on this, you can move your arms around. You can give it a big jog.  You can give it a twist to work the abdominal muscles. You can even sit down in a V and work those abdominal muscles.  This is so much fun, we keep it in the living room when my kids come home from school, they hop on it and tell me about their day.  We all spend a bunch of time jumping on the rebounder.</p>

<p>So I hope that I've inspired you to go out and get your own rebounder, or get it out from underneath the bed and put it in your living room!  That's the rebounder, that's moving the lymphatic system.</p>

Have fun bouncing!!!~
