<p class="lead">SMART, make ahead salad dressings, for the week! DONE!
A salad a day keeps the doctor away! We eat salads here for lunch daily. I used to make dressings fresh daily. Now, to save time I make them up and eat for 7-10 days. With at least one salad a day, 5 family members and sometimes guests, we are pushing out a minimum of 35 salad per week, at our house!</p>
<p class="lead">1.) Wilson's Mock Caesar Dressing</p>

<p class="well">
	<strong>Mock Caesar Dressing</strong><br><br>
<strong>2 cups olive oil<br>
1 1/4 cup lime juice<br>
1/4 cup water<br>
3 Tbs dijon mustard<br>
1 Tbs worcestershire<br>
3 Tbs ground flax<br>
1/2 cup pine nuts<br>
1/2 cup walnuts<br>
5 cloves garlic<br><br>

Method: Blend in vitamix on high. Massage into your kale and enjoy!</strong>

<p class="lead">2.) Wilson's house Vinaigrette</p>


 <p class="well">
 <strong>House Vinaigrette<br><br>

2 cups olive oil<br>
1 1/2 cups, freshly squeezed lemon<br>
3 inches of ginger root, peeled and chopped before blending (less if you don't like spicy)<br>
4 cloves freshly peeled garlic<br><br>
Method: Blend on high. Toss over any salad.</strong><br>
</p>

<p class="lead">Ideas to switch this up:<br>

1. Add fresh herbs (we love cilantro and parsley)<br>
2. Change the citrus base from lemon to lime, orange, grapefruit or pomegranate juice<br>
3. Add nuts like walnuts or brazil nuts to give this a creamy taste<br>
4. Add nutritional yeast for a cheesy mouth taste<br>

Both of these dressings will keep 1-2 weeks in the refrigerator.<br>

And that is your time saving tip!<br>

Enjoy!</p>
