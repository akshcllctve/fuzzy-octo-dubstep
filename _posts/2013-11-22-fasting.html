<h2>Do you clean your house regularly? How about your body?</h2>
Just think about all of the mold and funk that a body can accumulate. With so many twists and turns in the colon and all that moisture, it’s the perfect place for creepy -crawlies to thrive. But it doesn't have to be this way. In fact, our bodies have a built-in cleansing system that can be engaged through fasting. Fasting is the greatest healthy gift we have. It is our ability to shut down the digestive tract and allow our internal janitors to scour out free-radical damage. Free-radical damage occurs when internal cells are damaged by chemicals in our food, environment, air and water. Shutting down the digestive system allows the body to clean house! Fasting is something that I do periodically. Because we are so challenged these days by toxins, the cleansing process can be difficult. We may experience facial breakouts, nausea, bad breath, tongue coating, diarrhea, body odor, and more. Once we work through these, however, it is often possible to experience feelings of happiness and even bliss. Want a little more bliss in your life?

<h2>How to cleanse</h2>
&nbsp;

I utilize a variety of cleanses, such as gentle herbal cleanses, juice cleanses, or even brief water fasts. Today I want to share my version of one of my favorites: the Master Cleanse. The Master Cleanse is a modified fast that permits the use of lemon, maple syrup and cayenne pepper. I like to do this pre-holiday and I likely will do it again in January or February for a few days. I do love this cleanse!

&nbsp;

Typical results for me, after a 3-5 day modified Master Cleanse:

-Tiny bumps on skin clear right up

-Tummy goes completely flat

-Typically I lose 6-12 pounds, depending on duration

-Always stunned and astounded by the amount of waste I eliminate in a very short period of time. It is my understanding that the average person dies with 25 pounds of fecal matter inside. Yikes!

-Mental clarity goes way up

-Appreciation for nature increases and spiritual awareness expands

&nbsp;

NOTE: the original Master Cleanse calls for only the juice of the lemon. I like to put the whole lemon in the Vitamix. I believe that this fiber helps me stay active during the cleanse. During any cleanse, it is optimal to get plenty of rest and relaxation. But please tell that to my three active kids! Ha! I have to keep my energy levels high, though. Therefore, I modify this cleanse by adding the lemon fiber and it still works beautifully for me. Please check out details to the original - and fantastic - master cleanse here http://themastercleanse.org

7:00 a.m. - One tbsp. epsom salt in 16 ounces of warm water

Throughout day: Blended in Vitamix, lemon with seeds, pith and 1/4 of the skin still on, one tsp. maple syrup, pinch cayenne pepper, 8-16 ounces of water. As many drinks as you like.

9:00 p.m. - Calming bed-time tea, such as camomile

I will also add some green juices for nutritional richness.
