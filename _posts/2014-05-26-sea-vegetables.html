<p>Hi it's Lisa Wilson with The Raw Food Institute bringing you your 2-Minute Health Tip of the day! </p>

<p>
Are the answers to our health questions in the ocean?  Well, in many cases the answer is yes!  So today I want to talk about mineral rich sea vegetables.  They are filled with so many minerals, specifically iodine.  Now we have so much extra radiation in the air these days that our thyroid is just sucking up the extra radiation if we're not filled with enough iodine.  It's very difficult, frankly in any food source these days to get iodine so that's why we look to the sea vegetables. It's a natural source of iodine that your body knows exactly what to do with.  
</p>

<p>
So there's a million ways to get sea vegetables, do you think that I have enough dulse? Actually when I order my sea vegetables for the raw food institute we get big bags like this. Now I want to make this point, It's important where you get your sea vegetables from, so I like to get mine off the coast of Maine.  You want to have really clean waters.  It's also important how they dry it, you want it to be naturally sun-dried. You don't want a chemical process because they are just adding chemicals to this really beautiful food.  
</p>

<p>
So there are many, many different ways to add this, I just get the kitchen shears out, and cut it right under the salad.  You can kind of get this wet or marinated and make this into a really nice salad.  You can do the nori wraps, which I LOVE.  One of my favorite ways to eat it!  This isn't complicated, you can actually now get little shakers of kelp and dulse and put it right onto your salads, just like you used to do with your salt and pepper.  Just grab these, it couldn't be easier these days to get sea vegetables into your diet.  
</p>

<p>
My favorite way to eat it - I think once you discover kelp noodles they'll just change your life forever.  They come naturally like this, it's like a cooked noodle.  So when I do my raw curry soups or my raw asian salads, adding some of these kelp noodles, they're a little bit tough, but I just get out my kitchen shears, cut them right into my salad and they are absolutely delicious.  When I found these, I couldn't believe that I had never discovered kelp noodles before.
</p>

<p>
So I hope that you've enjoyed this, I hope that your going to go out and grab some sea vegetables and incorporate them into your life too.  That's your 2-Minute Health Tip of the day!  See you next time!</p>
