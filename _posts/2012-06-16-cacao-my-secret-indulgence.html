<p>YES, I MAKE MY OWN DIVINE CHOCOLATES! SOMETIMES STRAIGHT UP, SOMETIMES IN CHIPS FOR RAW COOKIES, SOMETIMES IN A CASHEW NUT CUP.... BUT ALWAYS, ALWAYS AMAZING. I'VE SPENT MANY LATE NIGHTS IN THE KITCHEN PERFECTING RAW CACAO SENSATIONS!!!</p>

<p>Super cool fact: Cacao has over 300 identifiable chemical healthy compounds! ((((PRETTY SURE THIS IS WHY I CRAVE IT))))</p>

<p>Also, high in: tryptophan (a known anti-depressant), bundles of antioxidants and other beneficial compounds known to have rejuvenating and anti-aging elements! ((GOTTA LOVE THAT!))</p>

<p>In ancient cultures, cacao has always been associated with stimulation fertility~~~hence the heart shaped box of truffles on Valentines Day still today!</p>

<p>Also, high in magnesium~and frankly we Americans are mostly all deficient in this category!</p>

<p>Ancient civilizations: was used as currency! I can see why!!! It was seen as 'food for the gods.'</p>

<p>Historically: used to stimulate the kidneys &amp; bowels.
More historic uses: treating anemia, fatigue, respiratory problems, low sex drive and more!
Today: also used as a great skin moisturizer!!!</p>

<p>Nicknamed 'black gold' by the Spanish!!</p>

<p>Cacao and chocolate was widely used by ancient civilizations as currency and was seen as a 'food for the gods.'</p>

<p>In modern day culture, many movies have been centered around chocolate! I know a couple of my favorite picks have involved chocolate!!!</p>

<p>And did you know that 50% or women prefer chocolate to sex?</p>

<p>Aztecs and Mayans cultures considered the cacao bean to be sacred and revered .</p>

<p>From the cacao tree, may we long continue our blissful affair with this divine sensation!</p>

<p>I hope you can enjoy some cacao today too!!!! ;))</p>
