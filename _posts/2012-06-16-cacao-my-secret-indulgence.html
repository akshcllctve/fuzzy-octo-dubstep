YES, I MAKE MY OWN DIVINE CHOCOLATES! SOMETIMES STRAIGHT UP, SOMETIMES IN CHIPS FOR RAW COOKIES, SOMETIMES IN A CASHEW NUT CUP.... BUT ALWAYS, ALWAYS AMAZING. I'VE SPENT MANY LATE NIGHTS IN THE KITCHEN PERFECTING RAW CACAO SENSATIONS!!!

Super cool fact: Cacao has over 300 identifiable chemical healthy compounds! ((((PRETTY SURE THIS IS WHY I CRAVE IT))))

Also, high in: tryptophan (a known anti-depressant), bundles of antioxidants and other beneficial compounds known to have rejuvenating and anti-aging elements! ((GOTTA LOVE THAT!))

In ancient cultures, cacao has always been associated with stimulation fertility~~~hence the heart shaped box of truffles on Valentines Day still today!

Also, high in magnesium~and frankly we Americans are mostly all deficient in this category!

Ancient civilizations: was used as currency! I can see why!!! It was seen as 'food for the gods.'

Historically: used to stimulate the kidneys &amp; bowels.
More historic uses: treating anemia, fatigue, respiratory problems, low sex drive and more!
Today: also used as a great skin moisturizer!!!

Nicknamed 'black gold' by the Spanish!!

Cacao and chocolate was widely used by ancient civilizations as currency and was seen as a 'food for the gods.'

In modern day culture, many movies have been centered around chocolate! I know a couple of my favorite picks have involved chocolate!!!

And did you know that 50% or women prefer chocolate to sex?

Aztecs and Mayans cultures considered the cacao bean to be sacred and revered .

From the cacao tree, may we long continue our blissful affair with this divine sensation!

I hope you can enjoy some cacao today too!!!! ;))
