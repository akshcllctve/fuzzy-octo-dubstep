Growing my own food is delivering the highest vibrational frequency to my body.
1. It's still alive when I put it on my plate
2. It's grown in conditions that I control
3. It has incredibly high nutritional density
All food has energy, and when we grow &amp; prepare it ourselves it has the ability to help us achieve stunning results....

This is sunflower &amp; pea sprouts! I grow them constantly in my home!!!!! :))

**I CAN'T AFFORD TO EAT HEALTHY
**I DON'T HAVE ROOM TO GROW MY OWN FOOD
Sound familiar? DID YOU KNOW: When Steve Meyerowitz (aka: The Sprout Man) began growing his own sprouts and wheat grasses, he could grow enough food in his one bedroom Manhattan apartment to feed 200 people? Cost: $1.50 per tray!

I try to get all the seeds off, which I can usually achieve by just lightly brushing my hands through the sprouts. That said, yes I often do eat a shell or two. Just good fiber..... ;)
