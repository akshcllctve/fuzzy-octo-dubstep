<p>Growing my own food is delivering the highest vibrational frequency to my body.</p>
<ul><li>1. It's still alive when I put it on my plate</li>
<li>2. It's grown in conditions that I control</li>
<li>3. It has incredibly high nutritional density</li></ul>
<p>All food has energy, and when we grow &amp; prepare it ourselves it has the ability to help us achieve stunning results....</p>

<p>This is sunflower &amp; pea sprouts! I grow them constantly in my home!!!!! :))

<p>**I CAN'T AFFORD TO EAT HEALTHY</p>
<p>**I DON'T HAVE ROOM TO GROW MY OWN FOOD</p>
<p>Sound familiar? DID YOU KNOW: When Steve Meyerowitz (aka: The Sprout Man) began growing his own sprouts and wheat grasses, he could grow enough food in his one bedroom Manhattan apartment to feed 200 people? Cost: $1.50 per tray!</p>

<p>I try to get all the seeds off, which I can usually achieve by just lightly brushing my hands through the sprouts. That said, yes I often do eat a shell or two. Just good fiber..... ;)</p>
