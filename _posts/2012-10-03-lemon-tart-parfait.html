<p>Our taste of luxury today! A lemon tart parfait with sprouted buckwheat and berries. We love 100% Raw!</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-2111 alignleft" style="margin: 4px;" title="Lemon Tart Parfait" src="http://therawfoodinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/182608_201791839838140_3734015_n-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />I've seen the company Goraw put it in their breakfast cereals. I sprout and dehydrate my own. I've seen some online companies sell it as "Buckwheaties." Super delicious raw, gluten free option for those moments when you might want a cereal. I keep a mix of sprouted buckwheat, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, hemp seeds and cinnamon. I add some slivered green apple, or some fresn berries, and a splash of almond milk. Hits the spot when I'm in a big hurry, or crave a cereal!</p>

<p>You don't HAVE to dehydrate, but without the step the groats will be mushy - after dehydrating they have some crunch. But go for it and let us know!</p>

<p>If you do splurge for a dehydrator, you will love it! I use mine constantly to dry fruit, desserts for my kids, kale chips and sooo much more! Delicious! You might try some of these items first at naturalzing.com, or Lydia's organics. Both have good products to taste, before you purchase a machine for yourself!</p>
