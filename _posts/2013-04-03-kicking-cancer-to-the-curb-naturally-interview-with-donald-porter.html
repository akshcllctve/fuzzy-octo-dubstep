<p>Retired investment banker, Donald Porter: reverses (2007)  stage IV prostate cancer (psa: 39),  metastasized to hip bone naturally, with food &amp; one magical (&amp; simple) solution.  From the LIVE INTERVIEW on  SUNDAY MARCH 31, 7PM.</p>

<p>From Donald:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2465" style="margin: 4px;" alt="Donald Porter" src="http://therawfoodinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Donald_Porter.jpeg" width="226" height="150" />As a retired Investment Banker I was aware (sort of) of the extensive use of chemicals to produce our foods (animal &amp; vegetable)therefore sought to minimize the use of these foods.</p>

<p>In April 2007, however, I was diagnosed with Stage IV Metastasized Prostate Cancer with 3+ years to live, if I complied with the recommended medical procedures.</p>

<p>I opted to do NO CHEMO, NO RADIATION &amp; minimal drugs. Rather, I chose to adopt a stringent organic whole/plant/raw food diet. Certain books that I had read about relying on our over-worked (by chemicals, etc.) Immune Systems seemed like the best way to beat my Stage IV Cancer. This Immune Enhancing Diet (along with a few other specifics) worked to allow me to beat my cancer in about 6 months.</p>


<p>Also a high pH Alkaline Protocol derived from Dr. Otto Warburg, Noble Prize Winner for identifying the cause and cancer cure, became available, so I adopted this Protocol also.</p>
<p>I still maintain a not so stringent organic whole/plant/raw food diet enjoying Exceptional Health and NO cancer recurrence.</p>
