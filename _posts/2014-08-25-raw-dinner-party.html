<p class="lead">Summer is coming to an end and the kids are going back to school. I want to get one more dinner party in with friends while the weather is still nice. This is a four course raw dinner party with simple recipes and in season ingredients that you can whip together in no time to impress all of your friends.</p>
<p class="lead">For the first course I decided to use the most popular appetizer from The Raw Food Institute: Rawvioli!</p>

<p class="well">
	<strong>Rawvioli</strong><br><br>
<strong>Yield: approx. 25 rawviolis<br><br>

1 or 2 turnips, jicama, or other root vegetable that can be very thinly sliced<br>
1 cup macadamia nuts, soaked & dehydrated<br>
1 cup pine nuts, soaked & dehydrated<br>
2 cloves garlic<br>
1 Tbs dried tarragon<br>
2 Tbs fresh lemon juice<br><br>

Stir in:<br>
1⁄3 cup finely diced red bell pepper<br>
1⁄3 cup finely diced onion<br>
1⁄4 cup finely chopped parsley<br><br>

Method:<br>
1. In a food processor, combine the macadamia nuts, pine nuts, garlic, and dried tarragon. Process to a fine, oily crumble. Add the lemon juice and flavor enhancer and process further to a thick, pate consistency mixture.<br>
2. By hand, stir in the red bell pepper, onion, and parsley. Season to taste.<br>
3. Using a mandoline type slicer, slice the root vegetable very thinly. Place approximately 1 Tbs of filling on one slice. Press another slice of root vegetable on top and push the edges down around
it. Dehydrate for several hours for a “cooked” appeal. Top with your favorite sauce. I used
balsamic vinegar for this one. flavor enhancer or your choice, to taste</strong>
