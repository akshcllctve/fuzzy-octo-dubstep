<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-2706 aligncenter" alt="Organics" src="http://therawfoodinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/995184_10201373882323524_1495355168_n.jpg" width="480" height="640" />Very weary of people suggesting that organics is for elitist snobs. There are soooo many ways to eat well on a budget!
<ul><li>1.) Blend in stead of juice--if you have to.</li>
<li>2.) Join a CSA or visit your local farmers markets</li>
<li>3.) Grow your own food--sprouts &amp; grasses are easy-peasy &amp; require just a 10 day growing period. Trust me, if I can do this, anyone can. $1.50 per tray, vs $3.50 per baggie in supermarket</li>
<li>4.) Eat soup! Do you have any idea how FAR soup stock goes? Make a giant batch &amp; freeze for many, many meals.</li>
<li>5.) Do your own jar spouting. Dried mung, lentils, garbanzo, fenugreek etc Start with just an inch of dried in a one quart Jar. 48 hours later, your jar is FULL of FRESH LIVING FOOD!</li>
<li>6.) Healthy grains are still fairly inexpensive &amp; go a LONG way!</li></ul>
THIS IS NOT ABOUT WILL POWER. IT IS ABOUT SKILL POWER!</p>
