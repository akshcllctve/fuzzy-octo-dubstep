2 c.		almonds (or other nut you love)<br>
1 ½ c.		dates, chopped to make sure there are no pits<br>

In a food processor, add almonds & salt and process until fairly fine. Start adding dates one at a time, until mixture becomes clumpy and sticks together.  You may have to add a little water – but not too much!  Take mixture out and press into a pie plate or spring-form pan.<br></strong></p>
