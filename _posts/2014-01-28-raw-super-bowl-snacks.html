<p class="lead"><strong>Sunburgers-</strong>  This all american comfort food is rich, textural and always a winner.</p>

<p class="well">
<strong>Sunburgers</strong><br><br>
<strong>Yield:</strong> 7 to 8 servings<br><br>

<strong>2 ½ cups sunflower seeds</strong> soaked & dehydrated<br>
<strong>½ red onion</strong> roughly chopped<br>
<strong>2 cups celery</strong> chopped<br>
<strong>1 cup turnip</strong> chopped<br>
<strong>2 cloves garlic</strong> chopped<br>
<strong>1 cup chopped parsley</strong><br>
<strong>1-2 tsp. poultry seasoning</strong><br>
<strong>2 tbs. ground flax or chia seeds</strong><br>
your choice of salty seasoning, to taste<br><br>

<strong>Stir in:</strong><br>
1 cup shredded carrot or zucchini<br>
soaked & dehydrated sunflower seeds, for outside of burgers<br><br>

<strong>Method:</strong><br><br>

In a food processor, using the S-blade, combine the onion, celery, turnip, garlic, parsley, poultry seasoning, first 2 1/2 c. sunflower seeds, salty seasoning, and flax/chia. Process until the mixture is slightly sticky and holds together. Season to taste. By hand mix in the shredded carrot or zucchini.<br><br>

Form the mixture into patties. Press the extra sunflower seeds around the patty to form a crust. Place the crusted patties on a dehydrator tray (using Teflex sheets or unbleached parchment paper beneath). Dehydrate 1-2 days or until desired dryness of the burger is achieved. Flip the burgers approximately halfway through, or as soon as they can be flipped.<br><br>Serve on onion bread (see below)</p>

<p class="well">
<strong>Onion Bread for Sunburgers</strong><br><br>

<strong>Yield:</strong> 2 ½ trays worth<br><br>

<strong>6 onions</strong> julienne<br>
<strong>1 ½ c. chia seed</strong> ground<br>
<strong>1 ½ c. sunflower seeds</strong> soaked & dehydrated, then ground<br>
<strong>2 c. water</strong><br>
<strong>½ c. Coconut Aminos</strong><br>
<strong>¼ c. extra virgin olive oil</strong><br><br>

<strong>Method:</strong><br><br>

In a large mixing bowl, combine the onions, coconut aminos or soy sauce, and olive oil. Let marinate for at least 20 minutes.
<br><br>
To the bowl, add the ground chia seed, sunflower seed and water. Stir to mix well. The mixture should resemble a thick, gooey batter. Add more water if needed.<br><br>

Spread the batter on dehydrator trays, using a ParaFlexx sheet beneath. I typically get 2 1/2 trays out of this quantity. Dehydrate for several hours, then flip and dehydrate further until the desired level of doneness has been achieved. You want the bread firm yet flexible.
<br><br>
<strong>Tips:</strong><br><br>

Slice the onions using a mandoline or other thin slicer; the thinner and smaller they are cut, the better the bread will come out. I also like to add finely chopped kale to this batter. This basic recipe can be modified and flavored in many ways!</p>

<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/pizza.jpg"><br><br>
<p class="lead"><strong>Pizza-</strong> Who doesn't love pizza? Adults and kids alike will go crazy for this tasty take on everyones favorite.  Wait till you try the creamy nut cheeze... YUM!!</p>

<strong>2 tsp. nutritional yeast</strong><br>

<strong>⅔ cup flax meal</strong><br>

<p class="well"><strong>Basic Nut Cheeze for Pizza</strong><br><br>

<strong>Yield:</strong> enough for one pizza (crust recipe above)<br><br>

<strong>1 c. macadamia nuts, cashews, pine nuts – or another nut or seed you would like to try</strong> (for seeds, I would use a combination of hemp seeds, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds – and soak the sun and pumpkin seeds first.)<br>

<strong>1 tbs. fresh lemon juice (more or less to taste)</strong><br>
<strong>1-2 tbs. nutritional yeast</strong><br>
<strong>1 garlic clove (optional)</strong><br>
<strong>salty seasonings</strong> to taste<br>
<strong>drizzle of olive oil or coconut oil</strong><br>
<strong>water</strong> as needed to get a creamy consistency<br>
<br>
<strong>Method:</strong><br><br>

Add all ingredients to food processor and start processing. Add in just the right amount of water until you achieve a creamy and thick cheesy consistency. You can also try this in the Vitamix as well, you might need to use the tamper to push all the nuts into the blade.</p>
