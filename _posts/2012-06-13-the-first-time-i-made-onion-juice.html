<p>Sure enough, a little research took me down a path I NEVER EXPECTED. Turns out onions top the list with their medicinal powers.... Make a shot of onion juice and you've got: ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL TONICS ON THE PLANET!</p>

<p>Also, look for the 40 day onion juice cleanse. Do a shot a day for 40 days. It's intense! You have to get into the right mindset, make yourself a shot and say ,"Bottoms up! Anything in the name of health!"</p>

<p>It is so powerful, it really does not taste like onions at that point, rather more like a shot of hard alcohol... throwback to college days!</p>

<p>Nauseous? It likely means you really need this juice. Just drink slowly and put your mind to it. You can do this!
<ul>
	<li>Balding? Try rubbing some onion juice right onto your head. It has a reputation for hair regrowth!</li>
	<li>Just the fumes can be enough to alleviate pink eye.</li>
	<li>Great insect repellent</li>
	<li>Help with cataracts</li>
	<li>Prevention of breast, colon and esophageal cancers</li>
	<li>Cough treatment</li>

<p>OH, AND IF YOU HAVE LEFT OVER ONION PIECES, JUST LEAVE THEM SITTING OUT IN YOUR ROOM. THEY WILL ABSORB ALL KINDS OF GARBAGE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE IN YOUR AIR.
