<p>Dr. Berkson (New Mexico) has a great track record with all auto immune disease help (85%).  I'VE HAD A LOT OF REQUESTS FOR THIS POST ON MY OWN AUTO IMMUNE JOURNEY.   He is a traditionally trained MD with a way open mind.   I met Dr. Berkson last spring as we were both speaking at at the Annieappleseed conference in Florida. I used this protocol of ALA &amp; LDN, along with Chinese herbs when I was diagnosed with Graves disease last Thanksgiving. By Christmas, just 6 weeks later I was good as new.</p>

<p>The usual recommendation for Graves disease is radioactive iodine, which I was happily able to avoid in a very short period of time. At that time, I had huge lumps on my thyroid &amp; graves was confirmed in a blood test &amp; sonogram.   Many of you have someone in your life with an auto immune disease.</p>

<p>I've had many request for this info, so I'm putting my research here.   He's also had some cancer success with this same protocol--see videos for that info. Dr. Berkson is a highly respected MD that lectures all over the country on this topic. He has been interviewed by Dr. Mercola,  Huffington Post and has even presented at NIH... Enjoy this info! The physician that developed it, here is his website:</p>
