The 7 Toxicities of Modern Day Society:
<ul><li>1.) Food toxicity: over 7,000 chemicals now may be legally added to food</li>
<li>2.) Organic Pollutants such as pesticides, insecticides, cleaning solutions, aerosol's etc</li>
<li>3.) Energy: cell phones, computers, televisions, electricity etc</li>
<li>4.) Heavy metals: mercury amalgams, antiperspirant, aluminum cans, metals in the water etc</li>
<li>5.) Opportunists: bacteria, mold, parasites, fungus, viruses, yeast etc</li>
<li>6.) Emotional Toxicity: people filled with anger, resentment &amp; who are unable to forgive</li>
<li>7.) Spiritual toxicity: Those lost, or without purpose. Rigid spiritual beliefs can also cause toxicity.Meaning, people who do not believe others have the right to their own personal beliefs.</li> </ul>

<p>Each of these toxicities can lead to illness &amp; dis-ease. Couple a few together &amp; you can create a swamp. Detoxification is a personal journey. As you begin to physically detoxify the body, you can start to detoxify emotionally too. This piece is often unexpected &amp; overwhelming.... But in the end, 100% transformational.</p>
