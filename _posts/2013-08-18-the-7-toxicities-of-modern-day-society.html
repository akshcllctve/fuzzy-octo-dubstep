The 7 Toxicities of Modern Day Society:::
1.) Food toxicity: over 7,000 chemicals now may be legally added to food
2.) Organic Pollutants such as pesticides, insecticides, cleaning solutions, aerosol's etc
3.) Energy: cell phones, computers, televisions, electricity etc
4.) Heavy metals: mercury amalgams, antiperspirant, aluminum cans, metals in the water etc
5.) Opportunists: bacteria, mold, parasites, fungus, viruses, yeast etc
6.) Emotional Toxicity: people filled with anger, resentment &amp; who are unable to forgive
7.) Spiritual toxicity: Those lost, or without purpose. Rigid spiritual beliefs can also cause toxicity. Meaning, people who do not believe others have the right to their own personal beliefs.

Each of these toxicities can lead to illness &amp; dis-ease. Couple a few together &amp; you can create a swamp. Detoxification is a personal journey. As you begin to physically detoxify the body, you can start to detoxify emotionally too. This piece is often unexpected &amp; overwhelming.... But in the end, 100% transformational.
