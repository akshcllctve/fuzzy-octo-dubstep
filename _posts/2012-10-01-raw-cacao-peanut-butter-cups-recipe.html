Yes, it is... Raw Cacao Peanut Butter Cups dessert is super YUM! During the week, we do our best to eat really well &amp; get our body the proper fuel to do what we need to do! That means we avoid sugar, and yes even the so called  "healthy desserts." Saturdays however, we can go bonkers. This was last Saturday's dessert! Like Reeses peanut butter cups? Sort of like that! Bottom:
<div>1 jar raw almond butter
1 cup cashew butter
(I made in VM with 1 bag raw cashews, &amp; 4 tbsp coconut oil)top:
3/4 cup raw honey
3/4 cup cacao powder
blend
add (slightly melted) coconut oil to taste(about 1/3 cup)Blend in the VM on low until smooth, then drizzle on top.
Refrigerate this dessert &amp; enjoy!
Hope you like it too! It's super YUM!</div>
