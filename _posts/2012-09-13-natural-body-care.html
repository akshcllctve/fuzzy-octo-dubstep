Haven't for years. ((On occasion, I wear a natural one made of lavender and bentonite clay--WOW, a deodorant that actually PULLS toxins from your body! Novel.)) Why? Those toxic chemicals go right up the lymph nodes. Did you know 99% of cancers in the breast contain parabens, a chemical found in many soaps &amp; deodorants.Won't touch an antiperspirant, as most contain aluminum. Kinda not so interested in Alzheimer's...Soap?? NO, I've ditched that too... I now wash my face with charcoal, or with my own mix of cucumber, chlorella &amp; clay.Showers? I use a peppermint oil. It's wonderfully invigorating.</p>


<p>My next frontier? I'm going to try dry shampoo, to see if I can go longer between hair washings.</p>

<p>Lotions? I've ditched them long ago. They will clog up the skin, and it won't be able to breathe! NOT GOOD! I bathe in coconut &amp; essential oils--shave with it too.</p>

<p>Tooth paste? My favorite is Thieves, though I have a few others. Often though, I just use coconut oil &amp; Neem oil.</p>

<p>Perfume? Can't stand it. Instant head ache now. Occasionally some essential oils will do.</p>

<p>Smell? I don't think so, or perhaps I smell just a little more me!</p>

<p>It feels sooo good to be naturally clean!</p>

<p>How about you? Have you gone natural too?? ;))</p>
