<p class="lead">You want to surround yourself with people who elevate you.</p>

<p>People who support your dreams.  When you tell somebody, a friend, your dream they should say "I'd love that! I know you can do that!"</p>

<p>Those are the people you want to be around.  You don't want to be around someone who's pecking at you, or somebody who deflates your dreams.  You want to be around people who elevate you.  In my life I choose to be around all kinds of people who elevate me.  Everyone from my work, to my family life.  You know, I once heard someone say that you teach people how to treat you, and I really believe that's the truth.  You DO teach people how to treat you.  These are the expectations that you have.  My expectation that I have is only FABULOUS~ people in my life.</p>
