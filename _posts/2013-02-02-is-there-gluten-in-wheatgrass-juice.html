Everyone is gluten intolerant;  just some people handle it better than others. It's kind of like the people that are lactose intolerant, everyone is, and just some do it better than others. Take enzymes if you eat dairy!  No one should be allergic to wheat, soil before planting the wheat seeds. This meant the wheat plants (the parents) were having to give the wheat seeds (children) a very poor diet, with less but we are now. Wheat, at one time, was the perfect and most complete seed on the planet, until farms started to not rotate crops and did not take the time to replenish the mineral content and more sugar so they would survive, just not as healthy and more prone to sickness (lack of sprouting).
Once the wheat seed is soaked and sprouted, the gluten is broken down into a more simple sugar that can be better digested by 'everyone'. I have gluten issues as well as Candida (which I am taking a pro-biotic to help) but can eat sprouted wheat seeds. When it grows as a grass, it becomes a GREEN, a plant, and, unless the person cannot eat live greens, it shouldn't be an issue to anyone.

There is NO gluten in the GREEN of wheatgrass, only the dry seeds.
The proof that I personally have is that I can put a pile of dry wheat seed &amp; a pile a soaked / sprouted wheat seed outside my greenhouse here in FL and everyone that comes by that day (everyone = birds, ducks, squirrels, raccoons, etc...) will stop to eat the sprouted wheat, no one eats the dry wheat seed. My other proof is simple; Hippocrates has people each week with gluten issues drink wheatgrass without any issues. I can remember anyone in my 20 years, have an issue with a gluten problem and drinking wheatgrass. I see people with issues drinking it because of other things, not the gluten.
