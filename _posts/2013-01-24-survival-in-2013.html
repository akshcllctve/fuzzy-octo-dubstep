<p>What does that mean? Well, believe or not, that is your choice! Get it? You can choose what to believe about your life, this Earth and where it is all going right now. You are in total control of your own life and how to walk your path. It‟s time to stop blaming the rest of the world, or other people, for what happens to you every day. I am not here to make that choice for you, just to offer information for you to choose what works best in your life. Whether or not anything happens in 2013, who knows? But, it will not change what I am going to say. Why not be better prepared, just in case? If nothing happens, then what did you lose? Most people don‟t want to know, and there is a part of me that totally understands that. At times, I wish I didn't know some things too! But, at the same time, when you have information, you can choose to change your path, or not. So, read on… or not, the choice is always yours.</p>
<p>Let‟s start with a list of what we need to survive. Keep it short and simple and get down to the bare bones of LIFE.</p>

<p>1. Oxygen!!!</p>

<p>2. Clean water.</p>

<p>3. Greens!</p>

<p>4. Shelter of some sort.</p>

<p>DONE.</p>

<p>Ok, now let‟s figure out how to make that happen. Well, what produces oxygen? GREENS! So, we need plants, leafy greens, grass somewhere in our life. Or plenty of Oxygen tanks! I suppose we can survive an amount of time without greens if there were enough in the air. Next is clean water. I would stock up on some of those travel carbon filters as they will turn coca-cola into water if need be. You can buy them anywhere and they last a long time, just don‟t really put coke through them! That will clean any water that you find, or even melted snow. Now we are back to GREENS. Interesting that they are on this list twice? How important are they??? Well, green gives us the energy / vibration and connection that we all need right now. Sun &amp; Earth, together make GREEN and that is everything our cells want to connect with. Sure, some greens are better than others, but we can use them all if we had to. I suggest that you have a hand juicer (no power needed, very important) to process the greens. Yes, you can chew them, and chew them and chew them… But be sure to chew them until they disappear. Don‟t swallow too fast.  (this was in newsletter #1) Ok, but what if there were no greens left out there? Now what can I do? Well, if you remember the „superfood‟ story, then you already know the answer. SEEDS! You will need seeds and some water (melted snow) to sprout the seeds, viola! There is your survival tip of a lifetime, yours and mine. NOW. Store some seeds and keep them DRY, in mason jars or hard plastic buckets. Not in the fridge, however frozen is „ok‟. As long as you have seeds, you will survive for a long time. This is why I am trying to speak more about “vibrational” living. That you really won‟t „starve‟ as fast as you think if you understand this concept. Lastly you will need some shelter. You want to keep warm. My advice is to be as high up as you can get without passing out. A cave is good. I am planning on a solar tree house in the mountains. Want to join me? Nice.</p>
<p>Oh, if whatever happens, keep in mind there will be no electric (TV, computer, etc…) and no running water or toilets (plumbing), so have your IPod with a solar charger to keep you company, or bring a friend with you, that doesn't talk too much!!! </p><p>Namaste</p>
