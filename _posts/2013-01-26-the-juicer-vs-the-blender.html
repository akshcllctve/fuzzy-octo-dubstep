<p>Why do people use a blender before they use their juicer? There is a very simple answer and, no matter what anyone tells you, this is the only reason people use a blender… IT‟S EASY! Much easier. Yes, for sure, it is very simple to use and then clean. Put stuff in, turn it on and rinse it out in the sink, done. Wait, but some companies say that the blender breaks down the foods better for our bodies and we all NEED fiber, don‟t we? How much fiber do we actually need? 28 grams? 30? 50? Well, doesn‟t that number depend on the calories you are getting? Someone will tell you the exact amount, but again, how do they know?</p>

<p>Who did they test? Were they male or female? What was their age? Blood type? Weight? Exercise routine? And on and on and on… Stop basing your life on a number or percentage that “they” said, or that you read on the internet. Keep asking questions and doing your research. However, don‟t lose yourself in trying to find the exact answer. Try being silent for a while and hold on to that one question. The answer will show up in front of you in no time at all.</p>
<p>Back to the BIG question on which is better to use. In my personal &amp; professional opinion, a masticating (slow turning, auger type juicer) is the BEST of the BEST out there. It will actually chew‟ what you put it in, slowly, like our own mouths will do, and will not destroy any life force within the food itself. A blender, nice concept and easier to use, is closer to a microwave than a juicer. Simple test to prove me right or wrong (if that is what you need to do). Take a cup of water and put it in the microwave for 1 minute. Let the water cool down and now water one house plant with that water. In about one month, the plant will start to die. Now, put a cup of water in a blender for one minute, let the water cool and do the same thing. Yes, after one month, the plant will start to die. The blender is doing the same thing that a microwave will do to your food. It is, for lack of a better term, „scrambling‟ up the energy, vibrational pattern of that food. It will change the structure of life force within that food. The food will NOT be better for you in any way after using a blender… wait, I take that back. The one good thing a blender will do that most humans do not do, is „chew‟ your food so that it will come out of you faster! AMEN to that!</p>

<p>Forgive this example, but you want to still eat fast food? Just put it in the blender before you eat it! Get it? There‟s no life in it to start with, so then, getting that food out of your body is the most important thing to do and the blender will help. Smile again, it‟s OK if you use the blender on occasion to make salad dressings, or some recipes or even frozen drinks, I mean smoothies!  Just use the “pulse” setting and do not leave it on for more than a few seconds. Good luck!</p>
