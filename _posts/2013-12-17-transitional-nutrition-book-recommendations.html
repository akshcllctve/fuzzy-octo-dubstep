Tonight, a good friend asked me for my top pick for 5 healthy food books. Her son (a radiologist) has newly shown some interest in the Joel Fuhrman diet and she would like to offer him some additional support. I've put my list of transitional books here. For most people, just understanding the basics of getting off of processed food, sugar and factory farming is the 1st step. Raw Food, I consider advanced nutritional techniques. Most people start with transitional foods, unless they are in a healing crisis. Here is my list of 13 top picks! Enjoy!
