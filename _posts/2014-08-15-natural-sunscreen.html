<p>In this fun new 2-Minute Health Tip, Lisa Wilson shows you how to protect your skin from the summer sun the natural way!

 <p>Hi it's Lisa Wilson with The Raw Food Institute bring you your 2-Minute Health Tip of the Day.  I'm sitting on my patio enjoying the sunshine and I want to talk about sunscreens, because you're supposed to slather up in chemical sunscreens right?  I mean the sun is awful right? Well, that's what we've been told for years, but we kind of have to undo some of that because it's not necessarily true, in fact vitamin D is essential and critical for maintaining health. </p>
 <p> But let's talk about the sunscreen for a minute, because we don't want to burn, and you want to increase your tolerance to the sun as the season goes on. So in the beginning of the season we do use sunscreens in our house.  This is a brand that we use, it's called <a href="http://www.badgerbalm.com/s-29-about-badger-organic-sunscreen.aspx" target="_blank">Badger</a> , and it was endorsed by the Holistic Women's Working Group, and its got ingredients that i like!  For example, the first ingredient is olive oil.  The second ingredient is beeswax.  You want to be able to read the ingredients in your sunscreen.  </p>
 <p>It makes me absolutely want to cry and grab the bottle out of these moms hands as they're slathering their kids with these chemical sunscreens.  What happens, it's not the sun that causes the cancer, it's not, talk to any holistic doctor.  But when the sun interacts with chemicals in your body, because you've eaten sugars, or chemicals in your sunscreen, it's that interaction that actually causes the skin damage.  So when you are protecting your skin from burning in the season, you want to pick brands with products you can actually read. </p>
 <p> Some people actually put coconut oil on their skin, I know it sounds counter intuitive, but it actually protects you from sun damage, from some of the harmful rays.  And frankly, most of the doctors I've worked with are more concerned about the chemicals in the pool, the chlorine, than they are about the sun.  Way more concerned about that, so they'll ask us to put a thin layer of coconut oil on our skin before we hop into the pool and that protects your skin from the chlorine. </p>
 <p> I want to show you this recovery, it's something i picked up in whole foods, and it's great for after you've spent the day playing in the sun, to put on your body.  Let me read you the ingredients.  Filtered water, vitamin E, calendula, lavender, sesame oil, geranium, chamomile and seaweed extract.  Did you see there were no chemicals that I was stumbling to read, there was nothing in here that I didn't recognize as food. That's what we want to do, put food on our bodies, because it actually nourishes us.  The average woman leaves the house in the morning after putting 500 chemicals on her body, between her shaving creams, her shampoos, her makeup, her underarm deodorant, and this is just a toxic assault on the body.  So we want to move to things we can read, that are going to give us something, that are going to nourish our skin and encourage health. </p>
 <p> I hope that you've enjoyed that 2-Minute Health TIp of the Day, I'll see you next time!</p>
