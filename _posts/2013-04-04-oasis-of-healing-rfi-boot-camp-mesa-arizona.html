<blockquote><strong>Dr. Thomas Lodi</strong>, a master’s level psychologist received his medical degree in 1985 from the University of Hawaii. He completed his internship and residency in internal medicine at Columbia University and worked for ten years as an internist, urgent care physician, and intensivist (ICU/CCU).

At his practice, <strong>An Oasis of Healing</strong> in Mesa, AZ, the focal point of treatment is on restoring the integrity of the immune system and organ function through detoxification and proper nutrition.  *Unfortunately Dr. Lodi will be out of the country for this Boot Camp.</blockquote>
