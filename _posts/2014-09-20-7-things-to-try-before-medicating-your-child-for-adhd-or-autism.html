<p class="lead">Child with ADHD or autism? List of what to try, before medicating your child:
THIS IS NOT WILL POWER. THIS IS SKILL POWER!~~7 steps here~~</p>
<ul>
<li>1.) Get child off of ALL processes sugar. This does not mean 'no treats.' It means, refines sugars. Learn to make natural snacks you can feel good about. </li>
<li>
2.) Get child off of all processed foods, and onto real foods. No packages. Chemicals and dyes contribute greatly to ADHD.</li>
<li>
3.) Go GFCF, or gluten free, casein free. Do one at a time. The <a href="http://www.gfcfdiet.com" target="_blank">GFCF website</a> below offers support an help for parents. Don't just switch to the gluten free packaged stuff. They've usually just swopped gluten, for a pile of chemical ingredients. Learn to prepare GF, nourishing whole foods. </li>
<li>

4.) Overwhelmed? Find a Holistic Health Coach in your area to help you navigate this transition. The whole family must get on board, not just the child. It is a family matter. This is a journey, not a destination.</li>
<li>
5.) Get on probiotics and probiotic rich foods, to reinoculate healthy gut flora. </li>
<li>
6.) Halt further vaccines. Get a religious exemption form from the nurse at your local school. It is your right as a parent.</li>
<li>
7.) Have a complete allergy test done. Food sensitivities or allergies can trigger these conditions.</li>
<li>
**** Can not even tell you how many children have turned their circumstances around 100%, by the parents taking action and doing these stepsâ€¦.. I've worked with dozens of parents through the years and successful kept their kids off the meds. It works! 
THIS IS NOT WILL POWER. THIS IS SKILL POWER!~~~~</li>
