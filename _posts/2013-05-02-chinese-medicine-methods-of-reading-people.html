I find myself here on Spring break, surrounded by people in swim suits. When you use Chinese Medicine methods of reading people, it is hard to not walk around &amp; mentally diagnose people all the time....
My poolside observations:::

#1) See how your nose is enlarged, with broken blood vessels? Your heart is in great danger. &amp; that swollen cheek? Your stomach is a train wreck. I suspect that you have you have very low hydrochloric acid levels which likely is causing you severe acid reflux. From the large indents by your upper lip, this stomach issue is also severely effecting your upper intestinal track. You likely have a probiotic imbalance &amp; leaky gut. Probably parasites too.
#2) Those swollen, twisted varicose veins in your legs are keeping blood in your legs &amp; potentially away from your heart. Your current challenge is to get circulation to your limbs &amp; through out your whole body. The rebounder (lightly) and the chi machine will be really useful in the short term. In the long term, improving your diet will make you feel better, will help heal your legs &amp; will help you drop some weight, so your body can facilitate healing. Without immediate diet intervention, you may be wheelchair bound in 10 yrs, or less.
#3) Those body sores (teen, wearing a shirt-obviously painfully aware of his body sores) are almost always a result of the gut. Eliminating sugar, soda etc, bringing in fresh vegetables &amp; adding massive amounts of probiotics both in supplement &amp; cultured veggies will restore your skin go good health.
#4) Sorry, those are not stretch marks: You have spirochetes, a co-infection of lyme disease. Likely this is long term lyme &amp; a good herbal protocol will be useful.

Arg... Ok. Today, try to enjoy the day...

OR set up a juice stand &amp; pass out probiotics!!! ;))
