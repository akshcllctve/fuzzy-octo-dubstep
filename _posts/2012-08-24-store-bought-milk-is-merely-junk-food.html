I wish people knew about the Harvard studies. They might be convinced that the milk campaign is a campaign and store bought milk is merely junk food.

The negatives from the study:
<ol>
	<li>Lactose Intolerance</li>
	<li>High Saturated Fat Content</li>
	<li>Possible Increased Risk of Ovarian Cancer</li>
	<li>Probable Increased Risk of Prostate Cancer</li>
</ol>
