<p class="lead">Let me share with you, one of my favorite videos of all time.  Evan was in 2nd grade when this happened, nearly 4 years ago.  When the school called me and told me Evan had forgotten his lunch, I suggested that he eat the school lunch and I would send some money the following day, to pay for it.  30 seconds later, my phone rang again.  A LOUD voice was booming through the other end of the line.  She said, "Your son is refusing to eat the school lunch!"</p>
<p class="lead">
It was a busy day for me, but I happily dropped everything to bring Evan his lunch.  A very proud mommy moment for me.</p>

I filmed this video that day, to show people what was in Evan's lunch.  What he turned down hot dogs and pizza for, in favor of THIS!</p>

<p class="lead">BTW, my kids are not little freaks of nature.  It has taken years of conversations to get to this level.  I try to teach them everything I know, so they are making their own wise decisions.  They understand that if you eat lousy food, you feel lousy.  They don't want to feel lousy.  They love being great athletes, having not one cavity among them, enjoying high honor status at school and never, ever missing a day due to illness.  Great food fuels not just your body, but your whole life and they totally get that!</p>
