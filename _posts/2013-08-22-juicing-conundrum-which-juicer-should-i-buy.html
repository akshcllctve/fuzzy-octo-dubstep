<p>JUICING CONUNDRUM? WHICH JUICER SHOULD I BUY?</p>

<p>*The best juicers are pressed juicers, such as the Norwalk. I have not even made this spendy splurge yet. These can cost thousands. I will some day, I will... It is my understanding, that every drip of juice is pressed out. Even wild animals will not eat the scraps, as there is no more nutritional value in the pulp. Pressed juice IS the most delicious juice I've ever had.
*Angel is a good machine too. Still expensive. If someone is in a healing crisis, they need a slow, masticating machine like the Samsung, or the Omega, or the Champion single gear--no question. I use these often.</p>
<p>*I also use my Breville. Breville is a fast machine. You will destroy some of the nutrients. True. However, on busy days if my choice is Breville juice, or no juice--I opt for Breville juice. Breville's are virtually indestructible machines. Even my kids use this one. You will replace the screen, WAY before the motor goes kaput. It is the difference between 35 minutes &amp; 5 minutes.
*I use my slow press, when I have the time. Also, you can not do wheat grass or sprouts in the Breville. Masticating machines are best for the sprouts &amp; grasses.</p>

<p>*A blender is NOT a juice machine. While it is a useful tool &amp; I love my Vitamix, it does not ever replace a juice machine. Nothing compares to fresh green juice to begin to nourish the body on a cellular level. Chlorophyll in green juice is the closest thing we have to the hemoglobin in our blood. You can give your blood &amp; immunity a daily boost by juicing regularly!!! Now that is ULTIMATE HEALTH!!
*These foods in combination can literally manipulate or change our DNA! See the book: Super Immunity for the latest research by Dr. Joel Fuhrman on this information.</p>

<p>Enjoy your green juice daily!</p>
