<h2>Have a piece of cake today!</h2>
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2604 alignleft" style="margin: 4px;" alt="Lisa Wilson" src="http://therawfoodinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/lisa_school_new-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" />"You don’t have to go raw, or vegan, or juice all day to have a healthy diet. You don’t have to give up all meat, and never taste chocolate cake again.." I pulled this from the blog site of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/holli.thompson1" target="_blank">Holli Thompson</a> today. Admittedly, my 1st instinct was : "HMPH!--What a message!" After I sat with it, I realized that she is most definitely right. In fact, I guess I like that she is not being a super dogmatic guru.... You know, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/joshuaIIN" target="_blank">Joshua Rosenthal</a>, has what he refers to as a 90-10 rule. 90% of the time you respect your body by eating super healthy &amp; 10% of the time you say what the hell....! Meaning, when you with friends at a social occasion, it is healthy (socially) to partake in that too.

Bottom line: Unless you are in a healing crisis (then 90-10 goes out the window in my book), go easy on yourself. Honor yourself with the best foods but have a little fun &amp; let your hair down sometimes too.

Have a piece of cake today!

((((**Did I really just say that!!! ;)))) Carpe diem!

<em>"I'm so perfect &amp; maybe one day if you really try hard, you can be perfect too!" ~~~</em>

You know, this is a message I hear by some nutrition experts &amp; frankly I find it a real turn off. I find it incredibly condescending. Want to know the truth? I know a lot of nutrition experts. A LOT! They are not perfect! Nope! Have not met a perfect one yet! They too are on a journey.... Just when they (self included) think they have it all figured out, they have an ah-ha moment that causes them to question everything they have ever promoted. I actually see this often. Bottom line with the experts in this field: It really is 1st about getting the public off of processed, refined sugary foods &amp; onto real foods. Next it is educating about organics, GMO's, factory farms etc. We may part ways on percentages, details, cooked, raw etc, but we all agree that real foods are key. Most of America is still on processed foods that cause an avalanche of disease. Promoting real change for schools, children &amp; for our nation is a mission we all share &amp; come together on!

I used to be a cheetos munching, soda guzzling, cookie snacking junkie~ Oh, &amp; I was often popping antibiotics too (as if that was the solution). I looked the part too. I was overweight, had purple cystic acne, fibrocystic breasts, irregular periods &amp; was just plain sickly all the time. My ah-ha moment came when I realized: That $#!+'$ not food! If I can get healthy, anyone can!!!

I love detox, clean raw foods etc. I'm into green juice, onion juice, garlic &amp; ginger drinks, sprouts, grass juices, medicinal teas, MMS, MSM, bentonite clays, mineral salts, herbs, oils &amp; a variety of therapeutic foods etc. I get super fired up about the medicinal power of foods!!! I'm a ferocious researcher on the topic of holistic cures &amp; I personally work with the top holistic dr.'s across the nation. It is my passion. As a coach, I'm sort of known for taking on the tough clients with major health challenges. Because of this, I consider myself a touch coach! In fact, I tell people that up front. I don't want clients who come with excuses, if their desire is true change. That said, I have 3 children too. They have friends who do not live this way. We do the best we can while at home, but do not make an issue when we are out. Some people feel that being super strict is a turn off. In fact, I think most people think this.... &amp; that is ok.... It is my life mission to effect the outcome of the future generations. I consider raw foods, advance techniques. I can usually not (unless they have a serious illness) take people directly to a 100%, raw, vegan diet. The leap is just too big. If I can turn people onto smaller changes like eating more greens &amp; putting fruit in the vitamix instead of haagen dazs... &amp; they like it &amp; think it is delicious, then they generally are open to more &amp; more change (such as green juice). Other small changes include: moving to wheat pasta (high GMO) to brown rice pasta to actual brown rice &amp; then to quinoa or sprouted quinoa. You see, I need to meet people where they are at, while educating about advanced techniques (raw, vegan) at the same time.... I hope this helps you understand my perspective! With great respect, Lisa Wilson
