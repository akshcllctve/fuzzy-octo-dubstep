Diagnosed with early stage breast cancer at age 44 (1993), Ann was suffering from Multiple Chemical Sensitivity and decided against chemotherapy.  Her efforts to change to a healthier lifestyle included going almost all ORGANIC, being more physically active, taking enzymes, doing coffee enemas, and much more.  She used juicing as part of the detox, and many dietary supplements.  Everything contributed to her successful journey, slowing the growth of the cancer through 5 years of recurrence (told she was Stage IV in 1997).  Fonfa remains cancer-free, shown by MRI, since 2001.

An advocate and activist who travels the US and abroad to share information via the Annie Appleseed Project.  On the web, on Facebook and Twitter
