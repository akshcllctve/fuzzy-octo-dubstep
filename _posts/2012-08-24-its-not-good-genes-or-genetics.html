IT'S NOT GENETICS!!!!
I'll part ways with you any day on genetics!

Please read new book by Dr. Joel Fuhrman called

Super Immunity. It definitively proves that we can manipulate gene expression with the foods we put into our bodies. GOMBBS is what he calls it. Greens, onions, mushrooms, beans, berries &amp; seeds.

The studies are groundbreaking &amp; profound! Also read: The Four Hour Body ((LOVE))

<strong>I spend YEARS IN A FAT BODY WITH CYSTIC ACNE LYING TO MYSELF !! I told myself that I was big boned, that I was destined to be overweight for life, that it was in my family genes!!!!</strong>

Please do not believe these lies. <strong>We have 100% control over our bodies</strong>, our health and the outcome of our entire life!!!! BTW, I'm 43 this summer and stronger than ever before. Why? Because I decided to be! I eat foods PACKED with nutrients every single day, and consider my gym workouts sacred time. I DO NOT MISS!

TRUTH: I'm really <strong>not</strong> into flashing skin shots, or bikini shots as I've done lately, but it makes me absolutely crazy when I dedicate my whole life to health and someone actually says, genetics!!!! Here's the secret: <strong>I WORK MY SUPERFLUOUS ASS OFF! IT'S NOT GENETICS!!!!</strong>

THIS IS WHAT WAS RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD, AS I WAS POSTING THIS....  :::
<blockquote><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lisa Wilson</span> Should I, or shouldn't I? Should I, or shouldn't I? This was the question running through my mind yesterday, before I hit the post button. DO I REALLY HAVE THE AUDACITY TO SAY THAT?? I hit the button. Glad I did! Stirred up such great conversation! Yes, I DO have a life that I absolutely love.... That said, HEALTH is a choice I choose every single day. It manifests differently every day, but it is always a conscious choice. I juice, grow sprouts &amp; wheat grass, make cultured vegetables &amp; kombuchas, work out, use a sauna, or a SOQI bed, do my skin brushing, make my own skin masks, get my sunshine (vitamin D), do my enemas, listen to music &amp; people who inspire me daily, hug up my family &amp; tell them how wonderful they are, pray &amp; meditate, laugh with friends etc. etc. etc. I truly have the most incredible life. It's exactly the way I've cultivated it!!!! ;))</blockquote>
I had no idea this would strike such a chord in people!

<span style="color: #ff0000;">WHAT I LEARNED:    I learned that deep inside us all is this outrageous desire to succeed.  I learned that we all have this tremendous passion &amp; drive to accomplish our dreams in life.   THIS IS WHAT STUCK A CHORD WITH SO MANY.  THIS IS OUR INDIVIDUAL, YET COLLECTIVE DESIRE....</span>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">JOEL FUHRMAN'S WORK NOW PROVES THAT WHAT WE PUT INTO OUR BODIES HAS THE ABILITY TO MANIPULATE OUR DNA!  WHAT A RADICAL NOTION...  WE HAVE CONTROL OVER OUR DESTINY!</span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I'VE SHARED THIS STORY HERE TO INVOKE THOUGHT &amp; TO INSPIRE PASSION.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE ALL OF YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE....  RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #0000ff;"> DREAM BIG!!!!!!!!</span></p>

<strong>Facebook comments after I posted this on my page.</strong>
<blockquote> Rolf R.  Very lovely!

Jake F. Lisa 2 questions, One may I ask your age ???

Gautam K.  A real beauty my friend.........simply nice.........

Jake F.  does this method work for someone whos immune system has been compromised by having their spleen removed ???

Donna P.   She's 43

Janice M.   Thanks for your passionate sharing about this!

<span style="color: #0000ff;">Lisa Wilson</span> I'm 43 in August. I also believe that the body is taking care of you 100% of the time, even when your spleen has been removed. Our bodies have infinite wisdom &amp; know exactly what to do, given the right tools.

Gautam D.  Really......you are going to be 43........unbelievable

Jake F.  I appreciate your opinion but in 20 years without a spleen infections have had their say now and again.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lisa Wilson</span> a must see movie!!!!<a href=" http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/you-can-heal-your-life/"> http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/you-can-heal-your-life/</a>

You Can Heal Your Life

Louise H.  has made a life out of healing people... on their own steam.

John B.  Ditto!, with the whole working my ass off thing:) and choosing transform. Love all your info. Lisa. Unfortunately, I still hate onions :(

Karen C.  Ellis BRAVO!!!

Julia  H.   yay!! just started reading it! ;)) Love following you! :)

Paul V D.  So Amazing

<span style="color: #0000ff;">Lisa Wilson</span> Thanks John &amp; Karen ...! Days like this that I feel vulnerable, because when you express the most sincere part of your self, you will get crucified by someone. Anyway, it had to be said, so thanks to your both for your support always!

Diane C.  Didn't realize you've had such an amazing transformative journey Lisa!!! You're an incredible role model for us all!!!! Thanks for sharing your amazing gifts with the world!! Love and Laughter ♥

<span style="color: #0000ff;">Lisa Wilson</span> Thanks Diane ! Yes, it has been a journey! Soooo great to know you. Love &amp; laughter to you too!!!! ;))

Karen  E.   Lisa, I support you 100%! You are an inspiration to all and your vulnerability is what I respect the most. Please keep posting because your words always seem to come at the right time, Love ya!

Pam G.  Bilfeld ‎Lisa Wilson I'm laughing at the comments from the men, because they're not so much interested in being healthy like you - they just want to go out with you!j/k

John B. Decided last year to no longer allow ulcerative colitis, stress, smoking and lack of time dictate how I look and feel. Simple but consistent diet, lifestyle and spiritual choices and I'm ripped and energized!!
Monica C.  Go Lisa! I am soooo with you!! It's NOT genetics! That's often a convenient excuse. I also love all of Bruce Lipton's groundbreaking work in the field-one of the first to prove in the lab that it's not genetics! The Biology of Belief is one of my faves!

Rebecca  D .  Dr. Fuhrman is my favorite right now. I'm reading Eat to Live in preparation for an interview at Whole Foods for Healthy Eating Specialist. He is so in line with IIN, etc. And you look great! :)

Cynthia H.   Gorgeous and totally correct. Dr. Brian Clement of Hippocrates concurs about genetics, was with him this weekend.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Ghina Si.   While epigenetics is useful, nutrition and exercise don't compensate (completely) for genetic mutations (not genetics itself), or mercury poisoning, etc. I believe you are correct for less than 100% of the time. I actually agree with you mostly, but it is the absoluteness of 100% that I question.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Kathy A.   Right on sista...just like you can change your jeans, you can change your genes :) Disease doesn't run in families...HABITS run in families!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Randy P.  I appreciate you posting this, because there are sooooo many people in our society that have fallen for the 'it's in the genetics' deception, and, because they've fallen for it, they do nothing constructive to address their ever-worsening health issues. I don't know you, but, from what you've said your health was like before, and from what it appears in the pic you've posted here, you are in far better health now than you were many years ago, and, I would imagine that you, and most people who've known you that whole time, would probably be in agreement that you look better now than you did years ago. That's substantively counter-cultural. Aren't you supposed to look and feel 'worse' as you get older? Apparently not. It's a message many more people need to hear and heed. Once again, thanks for posting this!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Kelly L.  Lisa .. I feel exactly the same way and say this all the time .... but wouldn't you agree that you have come to LOVE what you do in the gym and the kitchen? I hesitate to say we "work our asses off" because it's not like punishment .. to me it's now a privilege and a joy to make these things a priority. Thoughts?

<blockquote>Janet C.  I absolutely agree.. it's the environment that controls what the genes do... also read "The biology of Belief" by Bruce Lipton. I am a retired biology teacher. The information currently being taught is not up to date..

<span style="color: #0000ff;">Lisa Wilson</span> ‎3rd time in 2 days someone has brought that book to my attention! Looking forward to picking that one up! Thanks Janet &amp; Monica!

Kimberly R.

or candace pert...molecules of emotions; it's all there. : )

I just bought Super Immunity on Kindle.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lisa Wilson</span> Wonderful Kimberly R.! I'll pick those up too! You've piqued my interest... and well I'm a constant researcher, so I'm studying ALL THE TIME anyway!!! ;))</blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lisa Wilson</span> My gym workout of choice: Bodypump I do this 2 or 3 times per week. 3 lately. Additionally, I move every day: biking, hiking, roller blading, mountain climbing, ice skating, swimming, walking, kayaking, yoga etc. ... If I'm moving, I'm happy!!!

Vanessa J.  What is bodypump?</blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lisa Wilson</span>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsm0A1RTu6k">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsm0A1RTu6k</a> Here is a video on body pump. At the gym, it is way less "Hollywood" ,but at least you get an idea about what the routines look like. Fun music and lots of people around to keep you going. I was a fitness trainer for years, and this is the best I've found. It's completely changed my body in 6 months!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Vanessa J.  Whats your gym?

<span style="color: #0000ff;">Lisa Wilson</span>  My gym is not a national gym, just a very small local gym. Yet it is my understanding that any trainer can train to teach body pump. Most of the trainers at my gym also teach other things too. It is also my understanding that this is a class taught at many gyms around the country. I love it!</blockquote>
