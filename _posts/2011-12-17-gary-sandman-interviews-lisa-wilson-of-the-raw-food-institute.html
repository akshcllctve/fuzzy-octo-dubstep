I told her that I would like to do an interview where <strong>NO NUTRITION TOPIC IS OFF LIMITS!</strong>"  "She will also be talking about What inspired her to get into the field of nutrition, what inspired her to explore advanced raw healing techniques and what kind of crazy, over the top results she’s seen . . . WITH FOOD!  Could a bowl full of greens be toxic to you? COULD BE!  One person's dinner is another's poison - learn how to recognize what works for YOU. Lisa is going to clear up how on earth this could be possible!!! "
