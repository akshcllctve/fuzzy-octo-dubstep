<p>Welcome to our first edition of the CSA blog!  Here at The Raw Food Institute, we try to source our produce locally as much as possble, and we are so proud to support our local community supported agriculture. Our wonderful CSA, <a href="http://georgehallfarm.com/" target="_blank">George Hall Farm</a>, is right here in Simsbury, CT!  </p>

<p>Well we've been waiting all spring for this moment, and finally....This week a beautiful bundle showed up!  My favorite thing is the awesome bag our CSA came in that says "Don't Panic, It's Organic!</p>

<p>Ok. So here's the weekly challenge: to use everything up completely, from stems to tops!</p>

<h2>Pate of carrot, walnut and sage served over red butter lettuce topped with chives, garlic, radish. </h2>

<p class="lead">Recipe</p>
<strong>1 1/2 cups walnuts,</strong> soaked<br>
<strong>3/4	cups celery </strong>roughly chopped<br>
<strong>1 cups carrot </strong>roughly chopped<br>
<strong>1 cloves garlic</strong><br>
<strong>1/2	cup chopped fresh sage</strong><br><br>
<p class="lead">
1.  In a bowl, combine the walnuts, celery, carrot, garlic, and sage.  Process this mixture through an appropriate juicer using the blank (homogenizing) attachment.  For a more coarse pate, this step can be done in a food processor.  Stir in the dill by hand.  Season to taste.</p>

<p class="lead">2.  Wash and chop butter lettuce, cut the chives and garlic and slice the radish to combine salad.</p>

<p class="lead">3.  Serve pate over salad</p>

<p>NOTE: This mixture can be dehydrated and makes an excellent cracker.</p>

<p>Looking for that extra bit of protein?  Pates are so easy and give any salad the extra umph you need to get through the day.  The fresh flavor of the sage is unbelievable and the walnuts put this dish over the top.  You can sub the sage for any fresh herb or flavor enhancer.  I also love using the garlic stems.  It has such a mild flavor.  I just peeled them and cut them right into the salad just above the bulb.</p>

<h2>Tops Salad with beet greens, radish and carrot tops with a carrot top vinaigrette with baby carrots and radish topped with garlic</h2>
<img class="img-responsive"src="/img/2014-06-19-14.53.40.jpg"><br>

<p>Usually I like to cut my salad leaves into pieces but the tops of the beets and radish were so beautiful I couldn’t resist leaving them whole.  </p>
<img class="img-responsive"src="/img/2014-06-18-15.05.08.jpg"><br>

<p class="lead">Recipe</p>
<strong>1 bunch beet greens</strong><br>
<strong>1 bunch radish greens</strong><br>
<strong>1 bunch carrot top greens</strong> (greens only not the stem)<br>
<strong>2-4 baby carrots </strong> leave part of the stems on<br>
<strong>2-4 french breakfast radish</strong><br>
<strong>Hakurei turnip red</strong><br>
<strong>Chopped fresh garlic stems</strong><br><br>

<p class="lead">Dressing</p>
<strong>1 tsp raw honey</strong><br>
<strong>1.5 tsp dijon mustard</strong><br>
<strong>2T apple cider vinegar or lemon juice</strong><br>
<strong>¼ cup grapeseed oil</strong><br>
<strong>2 T minced carrot top greens</strong><br>
<strong>one stem chopped fresh chives</strong><br>
<strong>salt and pepper</strong><br><br>

<p class="lead">1.  Wash and combine beet greens, radish greens, baby carrots, radish and turnip.  Slice or leave whole.</p>

<p class="lead">2.  Combine honey, mustard, vinegar, grapeseed oil, carrot tops, chives, salt and pepper.  Either shake in a mason jar or combine in food processor</p>

<p>I was so stumped what to do with the baby bok choy but was really looking for a dinner option and came up with this.  </p>

<h2>Shaved Summer Salad with radish, turnip, carrots, beets and a tangy lemon mustard vinaigrette topped with fresh chives and fresh cracked pepper.</h2>
<img class="img-responsive"src="/img/2014-06-18-16.23.41.jpg"><br>

<p class="lead">Recipe</p>
<strong>3 small beets</strong><br>
<strong>2-4 radish </strong>(i used 2 of each kind 4 total)<br>
<strong>Hakurei turnip white</strong><br>
<strong>2 baby carrots</strong><br>
</p>
<p class="lead">Dressing</p>
<strong>¼ cup grapeseed oil</strong><br>
<strong>1.5 T lemon juice</strong><br>
<strong>2 t raw honey</strong><br>
<strong>1 t yellow mustard</strong><br>
<strong>salt and pepper to taste</strong><br>
</p>
<p class="lead">1.  Shave the beet, radish, turnip and carrot either with a knife or a mandoline as thin as possible.</p>

<p class="lead">2.  Combine grapeseed oil, lemon juice, honey, mustard and salt and pepper in a mason jar and shake.</p>  
<p class="lead">3.  Pour dressing over salad</p>

<p>This gorgeous display of vegetables is another great crowd pleaser.  If you are looking for a course or appetizer to add to a fancy dinner this is it.  You can also sub the vegetables out as the CSA season changes using zucchini, kohlrabi, fennel or whatever you get that week.   I have really been enjoying the beauty of the food and how to present it in such a manner that is pleasing to the eye and this dish really fulfilled me.</p>

<h2>Kale Italiano with  kale, cabbage, onion, red pepper, corn, basil topped with a simple Italian vinaigrette</h2>

<strong>3 c.  lacinato (dino) kale,</strong> chiffonade (long, thin, ribbon-like strips)<br>
<strong>1 c.  cabbage,</strong> chiffonade<br>
<strong>3T.  red onion, </strong>finely diced<br>
<strong>1/2 red bell pepper,</strong> diced<br>
<strong>2 ears fresh corn</strong><br>
<strong>1/4 c. fresh basil,</strong> chiffonade<br>
<strong>3 T. Extra Virgin Olive Oil </strong>or other cold-pressed oil<br>
<strong>1 T. Fresh lemon juice</strong><br>
<strong>1 tsp. pizza seasoning</strong> (I like the Frontier brand)<br>
<strong>Your choice of flavor enhancer</strong> (i.e. sea salt, nama shoyu, celery salt, etc.), to taste<br><br>

<p class="lead">1. In a mixing bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well. Massage the kale gently to expedite marination. Season to taste.</p>
<p>Note: I love adding a handful of dulse to this recipe. Avocado can also be substituted for the oil and mashed in. A small handful of chopped olives is also quite tasty! Consume at room temperature for the best flavor.</p>


<p class="lead">Lessons learned:</p>
1.  Use the tops first as they tend to wilt over time<br>
2.  Use everything - I juiced the stems of the carrots and beets!<br>
3.  If the herbs start wilting before you can get to them just tie them together and hang them upside down and they will dry out wonderfully and you can use them up!<br><br>
