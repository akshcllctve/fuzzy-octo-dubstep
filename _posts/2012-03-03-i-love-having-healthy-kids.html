<p>A couple of nights ago, my kids were playing around in the kitchen with the vitamix.   This is generally an every day occurrence, but this dessert was particularly tasty!  Remember Dreamsicles???  Ok, like this only better!!!!
</p>
<p>Thought I'd share:</p>

<ul><li>2 fresh oranges peeled</li>
<li>4 cups ice</li>
<li>1/4 to 1/2 cup fresh almond milk</li>
<li>1/2 tsp vanilla bean, or vanilla extract</li>
<li>raw honey, or maple syrup to taste</li></ul>

<p align="center">Blend in Vitamix on high, pushing sides down with tamper until completely blended.  This will likely only take 30 seconds or so to blend!  Then simply enjoy!</p>
