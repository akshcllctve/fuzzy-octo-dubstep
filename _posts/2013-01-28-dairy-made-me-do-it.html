Are you lactose intolerant? Sorry, what was your answer? I will give you one more chance to think about it before I continue. ………………………………… Was it YES? If it was, YOU WIN!!! I really didn't want to be the one to tell you, but you are lactose intolerant. We all are. I can prove it very fast, simple. If you have an ulcer, what are you told to do (by your doctor, go figure)? Drink milk. Correct. Why? Because milk will „coat your stomach‟. YES, it will coat everyone‟s stomach, because…………………… you CAN‟T DIGEST IT! No one can. Meaning that WE are all lactose intolerant. Some people just handle it better than others. Some take enzymes, some people are in their youth and still have those enzymes, while most others think their skin problems are because of the make-up they use, maybe they sweat a lot, maybe born with “white-heads”, etc… I hope you hear these next stories.
First, my story. At the age of 21, my skin started to itch. Out of nowhere, it was a maddening itch. All night long, under my arms, on my stomach and on my back. It was so bad, I couldn't sleep. So, after a few weeks, I tried things to fix it. I changed laundry soap, shower soap, shampoo, clothes, etc… anything that was getting on my skin, I changed it. NOTHING worked! I just wanted to sleep through the night and the more I scratched, the more it itched! I couldn't afford to see a doctor, let alone get tested, so I was stuck. After another few weeks, I met someone that had a similar issue with their skin and was taking a medication called „seldane‟, which was an allergy med that didn't cause drowsiness. I asked if I could take one as I was about to go crazy. I would have taken anything at that point in my life, it didn't matter what it was or who gave it to me. Well, let me just say how it felt to actually sleep through the night for the first time in months. WOW! I was happy! So happy that I didn't care what was causing this itch anymore, just get me more seldane! I had to have this pill because I would not go back to that misery of not sleeping. And this is how the medical profession &amp; pharmaceuticals have us hooked. Simple. We have a problem, they have a pill to “scratch the itch”. But, what is causing the problem?
Ok, I found a doctor through a friend and, after an hour of begging, because I couldn't afford the tests, I got the pills!!! YES!!! Happy!!! I took one pill, every other day, and all was good with the world. By the way, so you know me a bit more, there is NOTHING about taking any kind of pill that seems right in this big picture of life. Fast forward one year later… I met someone while I was working at Optimum Health that was also taking seldane. I asked, “are you allergic to cats and dogs like me?” She replied, “yes, but I am also allergic to dairy.” And there it was! ONE sentence spoke right to my skin. Ever since I started to eat healthier, I was eating more and more dairy. Now, I didn't believe that not eating it would do anything, but I thought I would try as the pills were a bit pricey. I spent the next two weeks coughing up mucus and blowing my nose. I wasn't sick, just „leaking‟…??? After those two weeks, I stopped taking the seldane and, to my surprise, the maddening itch was GONE! AMEN!!! IT WAS THE DAIRY! Oh, and another side effect was these tiny white heads that I had on my face since I was 11 years old, disappeared after three months of NO DAIRY. That was the greatest gift of all. Clear skin!
<em><strong>TRUE STORY TWO:</strong> By Melissa Netto, Delray Beach, FL In 1993 at the age of 8, I made the decision to become a vegetarian. Coming from a family of steak eaters, and being very young, I did not have access to vegetarian food, or the knowledge of staying healthy while being a vegetarian. At that time my understanding of health was limited to a very incorrect philosophy “Protein comes from animals. If you aren’t eating meat you can only get protein from dairy”. Hence my love affair with dairy began, and ultimately transformed into an addiction.</em>
<em>All during high school and college I was very active, my diet was as healthy as I could make it and dairy was a primary ingredient in everything I consumed. After college my physical activity all but ceased and I started noticing little bumps on my back, which I attributed to my tattoos. Then they started forming on my legs, must be from shaving. Ultimately, they appeared on my face. After numerous dermatologist visits, thousands of dollars in prescribed medicine, face washes, new makeup’s, facials, elixirs etc… the bumps refused to go away, until the day someone very wise gave me the simplest solution: no dairy + enzymes = clear skin.  My heart sank a bit, how could I go without dairy? Everything I eat is smothered in cheese, I consume about 2 gallons of milk a week, and yogurt is my favorite snack! But ridding myself of these bumps that had now spread to my entire body was an absolute must, so I gave it a shot. Within 2 weeks almost all of the bumps on face were gone. Within a month my arms, legs, chest and stomach were completely clear. WOW! My body was so over loaded with dairy that it was actually expelling the excess lactose through my pores! Since I stopped consuming dairy and started taking the enzymes, it allowed my body to start working on the surplus it had desperately tried to be rid of. Nothing else in my life changed, so I know for certain that this remedy works and I’m proud to share my story with anyone who will listen. So remember, our bodies are fine tuned machines. They tell us what we need to consume and warn us of what we mustn’t. Listen to your body; pay attention to warning signs and do not let food control you.</em>
