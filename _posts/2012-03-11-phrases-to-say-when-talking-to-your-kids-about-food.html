<p align="center"><strong>W HAT LANGUAGE ARE YOU "FEEDING" YOURSELF, AND YOUR CHILDREN?</strong></p>
&nbsp;

<img class="size-full wp-image-1548 alignleft" style="margin: 4px;" title="Children eating healthy" src="http://therawfoodinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/child_eating_healthy.png" alt="Children eating healthy" width="192" height="260" />For years, I've worked with parents who are moving toward healthy eating and healthy living.  The challenge is that once the parents flip the switch, and recognize the importance of eating healthy, how do they convince their kids that this is a wonderful thing to do?  I've developed a list of quotes that I use in my house, with my own kids.  They work beautifully because kids recognize  that you, the parent, are making these changes out of deep love for them.  It is soooo much easier to get them on board when they understand this.

I suggest:

-You add your own phrases to this list

-Print this list out, and tape it inside your kitchen  cabinet, your day planner etc and refer to it often
