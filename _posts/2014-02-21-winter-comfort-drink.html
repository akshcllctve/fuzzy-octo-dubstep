<p>My comfort food since I was a child was warm milk with walnuts in it. Someone once told me this was an eastern European tradition. I don't drink dairy milk anymore because it creates mucous in my ears, but I still crave warm drinks on a wintry day, so I came up with this velvety, milky drink alternative. Warming, comforting, delicious, and takes me back to my childhood memories every time :)</p>
	<p>Enjoy!</p>
