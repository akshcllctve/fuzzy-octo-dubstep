<p><a href="http://therawfoodinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Fruits.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2713" alt="woman with healthy food" src="http://therawfoodinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Fruits-300x229.jpg" width="300" height="229" /></a>With 149 plus comments on my Facebook page, at the risk of being crucified in the nutrition world... Something I NEVER talk about. Can't wait to wake up tomorrow to a slew of nasty comments &amp; a bunch of 'unfriends.' But it has to be said. Here goes:
This 80-10-10 diet. Abomination. Horrible. Can't support it even a little tiny bit-- What is it? 80% fruit &amp; vegetables, but mostly FRUIT-10% protein-10% fat Some even do 90-5-5
Why? I see the devastating results of those on the other side. Those who have tried it &amp; it failed them. If you follow this diet short term, I have no doubt people can lose weight. Endurance athletes may even be able to tolerate this for a period of time. But as a lifestyle? Um... just no. Drinking all of these fruit juices &amp; consuming all of these mono (fruit) meals day after day defies logic. Is fruit healthy? Yes, of course. At a balance of about 15% of your diet--&amp; that is if your are not in a healing crisis. Simply put, it is just WAY too much sugar for the pancreas to handle. This much sugar is the fast track to cancer, diabetes &amp; a host of other sugar causing diseases. Yes, fruit has sugar. Sure it is tied up with all vitamins, minerals etc... but still, a pile of sugar in these amounts.</p>

<p>A friend of mine recently died. Thus the reason for this post. Upon her cancer diagnosis, she had been on the fruitarian diet for many, many, many months. All this sugar, coupled with large amounts of stress coming together at once sent her body over the edge-- &amp; she could not recover. Heartbreaking. She was a healthy, beautiful 34 yr old woman.</p>

<p>I see many young people promoting this diet. They have youth on their side. Many people without much (or any), or any proper nutritional training. They try it, lose weight or feel better &amp; start thumping the fruitarian bible. Worse yet is when people allow the way they have been eating to define them, or their 'business.' Then they feel they can't come out &amp; say, "you know, I was wrong."</p>

<p>True seekers of health present the best knowledge of the best information they have at the time, but are ok with being wrong. They are ok with saying, I made a mistake.</p>

<p>I do my best never to attack anyone, or any health perspective. I recognize &amp; honor bio-individuality, blood type &amp; genetic heritage. But due to the overwhelming evidence, the cause for alarm on this one is too great....</p>

<p>In honor of my sweet friend, who left us too soon.</p>

<p>I hope you can appreciate my perspective....</p>
