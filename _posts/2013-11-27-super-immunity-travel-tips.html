TRAINS, PLANES, SUBWAYS AND GERMS

Super Immunity travel tips

Let's face it: sniffling, sneezing, vomiting, diarrhea, body chills and a sore throat are just not an option while traveling.  It ruins the whole experience. What might have been one of the best memories of your life can turn out to be a major disaster.

<ul>
	<li><strong>Here's how:</strong></li>

<li>1.  Bring your all-natural, healthy first aid kit  --  I'll show you mine (see photo)!</li>

<li>2.  Map out all of your healthy eating spots, before you leave, so it is a no-brainer once you are there.</li>

<li>3.  Fuel your body with freshly pressed green juice, every single day, for energy and super immunity.</li>

<li>4.  I'll show you my favorite spots in both New York City and Minneapolis.</li>

<li>1.  The all-natural, healthy first aid kit</li>

<p>Essential oils, by Doterra.  If I could pack only one thing, this would be it!  Slim and Sassy.  I know,  I know.  The name is deceiving.  This is, however, one of my favorite essential oil blends.  It is powerful!  Two drops under the tongue and you can feel invigorated.  It penetrates all cellular membranes.  It is both antimicrobial and antiviral.   It reaches internal tissues quickly.  On our last trip to NYC, day one, my nine-year-old daughter Harper got a sore throat.  We put two drops of Slim and Sassy under her tongue and two drops of Frankincense on her forearms, then went to sleep.  She woke up with no signs of a sore throat, pain free, and ready to take on New York City!</p>
<p>
NOTE:  Hold the drops under the tongue for one to two minutes.  The vapors alone are very powerful.  This gives them a chance to move into the sinus cavities.   When you place oils under the tongue, it will bypass the gut and move directly into the bloodstream for speedy delivery to your tissues, organs and cells.  Other great locations are the forearms and bottoms of the feet.  Transdermal delivery is one of the best delivery mechanisms for this natural and safe medicine.  Essential oils are very high on the O-R-A-C scale, a measure of antioxidants.  They also deliver a very high vibrational frequency.  They are a part of my life every single day.  I breathe them in my vaporizer, I put them on my pillows for a relaxing night’s sleep, and I put them under my tongue and on my arms and feet to improve my immunity!
</p>
<p>Other top pick travel options for oils:  oregano leaf, olive leaf, melaleuca and clove oils</p>
<p>2.  Map out all of your healthy eating and drinking spots</p>
<p>
Finding your new favorite eateries should be a pleasure and a joy.  Healthy food joints are popping up everywhere.  Ask around, look online and plan your meal stops before you leave.  Finding these places is always the highlight of my trip!</p>

<p>3.  Fuel your body with freshly pressed green juices</p>

<img class="size-medium wp-image-2770 alignleft" style="margin: 4px;" alt="Super immunity travel tips" src="http://therawfoodinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1475915_10201850373795513_1313909729_n-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" />
<p>In most major metropolitan areas, juice bars are now everywhere.  Pressing fruits and vegetables preserves the nutrient value in the juice.  This means the juice stays fresh for 24 hours.  It also means there is no waiting for your juice!  Just walk in, grab, and go!  If you have a way to keep it cool, you can buy several to keep you fueled all day.  Be sure, though, to ask if it is organic.  A big bottle of pesticides should not be part of your morning routine.</p>

<p>BONUS: I was just at a conference in NYC.  I was the fresh juice supplier for a small group of friends.</p>
<p>
I met a potentially amazing book agent while I was at this conference.  On day two, I kept her fully juiced.  Think she will remember me?  You bet she will!

4.  New York City and Minneapolis hot spots</p>

<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>

<a href="http://www.lepainquotidien.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Le Pain Quotidien</span></a> - My family loves this spot.  They also have many vegan, gluten-free and raw options!  It is so cozy; it almost feels like home.  We went there three times on this trip alone!  Great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

<a href="http://www.raw-q.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quintessence</span></a> -  Stopped there for a quick lunch and we were more than impressed.  Love that all lunches come with a side salad and the green dressing served with the salad is delightful!  The raw pumpkin pie with the coconut cream was the perfect spicy dessert for a fall or winter day.

<b>New York upscale eats: </b>

<a href="http://oneluckyduck.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pure Food &amp; Wine</span></a> - If you want a beautiful, gourmet raw food meal, I highly recommend visiting Pure Food &amp; Wine.  Ahhhh, date night?

<a href="http://www.ecopolitan.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ecopolitan</span></a> - A truly raw experience, the Ecopolitan makes following a medicinal raw diet easy.  The smoothies are amazing as well.  The flavor combinations here are an extraordinary experience.
