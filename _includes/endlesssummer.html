  <h2>Endless Summer</h2>

<h4>Due to popular demand, this summer we are offering not 1 but <strong>2 Live Immersion Retreats!!!</strong> The last few years we had to turn many people away because we didn't have space in our July class.  This year we want everyone who wants to come to be able to, so we worked with our partners at The Simsbury Inn, who graciously helped us squeeze in a second summer retreat August 3-9th.  Cleanse your body and spirit with our award winning detox program, and enjoy our beautiful location and enjoy eating outside, walking or biking the area's trails, and more.  There really has never been a perfect time to come! Don't wait, the August class will be our LAST RETREAT this year!</h4><h2><font color="e67e22">Register in April and get a FREE PRIVATE ROOM UPGRADE, a $455 value.
